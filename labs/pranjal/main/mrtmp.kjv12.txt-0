Book 01	Genesis

001:001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
        upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
        the face of the waters.

001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

001:004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
        light from the darkness.

001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
        Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
        waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
        under the firmament from the waters which were above the
        firmament: and it was so.

001:008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
        morning were the second day.

001:009 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
        together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it
        was so.

001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
        of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
        yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
        kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

001:012 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
        after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in
        itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

001:014 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
        heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
        signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
        give light upon the earth: and it was so.

001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
        day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars
        also.

001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
        upon the earth,

001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the
        light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
        creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth
        in the open firmament of heaven.

001:021 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
        moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their
        kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that
        it was good.

001:022 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
        fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the
        earth.

001:023 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

001:024 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
        after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the
        earth after his kind: and it was so.

001:025 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
        after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth
        after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

001:026 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
        likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
        and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
        all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
        upon the earth.

001:027 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
        created he him; male and female created he them.

001:028 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
        multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
        dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
        air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

001:029 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
        seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,
        in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it
        shall be for meat.

001:030 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
        and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
        is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was
        so.

001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
        very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
        of them.

002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
        and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
        had made.

002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
        that in it he had rested from all his work which God created
        and made.

002:004 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
        they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth
        and the heavens,

002:005 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
        every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had
        not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man
        to till the ground.

002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
        face of the ground.

002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
        breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
        a living soul.

002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there
        he put the man whom he had formed.

002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
        that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
        life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
        knowledge of good and evil.

002:010 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from
        thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth
        the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the
        onyx stone.

002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
        compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

002:014 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
        goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is
        Euphrates.

002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
        Eden to dress it and to keep it.

002:016 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of
        the garden thou mayest freely eat:

002:017 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
        not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
        shalt surely die.

002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
        alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
        field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam
        to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
        every living creature, that was the name thereof.

002:020 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
        and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not
        found an help meet for him.

002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
        slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
        instead thereof;

002:022 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
        woman, and brought her unto the man.

002:023 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
        flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
        Man.

002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
        shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
        ashamed.

003:001 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
        which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
        hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
        of the trees of the garden:

003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
        garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
        ye touch it, lest ye die.

003:004 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

003:005 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
        eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
        and evil.

003:006 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
        that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
        make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and
        gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

003:007 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
        were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
        themselves aprons.

003:008 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden
        in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves
        from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the
        garden.

003:009 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
        art thou?

003:010 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
        afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

003:011 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou
        eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou
        shouldest not eat?

003:012 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,
        she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

003:013 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
        hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
        did eat.

003:014 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
        this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast
        of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
        thou eat all the days of thy life:

003:015 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
        thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
        shalt bruise his heel.

003:016 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
        thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and
        thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
        thee.

003:017 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
        voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I
        commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is
        the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
        the days of thy life;

003:018 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and
        thou shalt eat the herb of the field;

003:019 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
        return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
        dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

003:020 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the
        mother of all living.

003:021 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
        skins, and clothed them.

003:022 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,
        to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand,
        and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

003:023 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
        to till the ground from whence he was taken.

003:024 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
        garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned
        every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

004:001 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,
        and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

004:002 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
        sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

004:003 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of
        the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

004:004 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and
        of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to
        his offering:

004:005 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain
        was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

004:006 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is
        thy countenance fallen?

004:007 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou
        doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be
        his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

004:008 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,
        when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel
        his brother, and slew him.

004:009 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
        said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

004:010 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's
        blood crieth unto me from the ground.

004:011 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
        mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

004:012 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield
        unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou
        be in the earth.

004:013 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I
        can bear.

004:014 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
        earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a
        fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to
        pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.

004:015 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
        vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a
        mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

004:016 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in
        the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

004:017 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and
        he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the
        name of his son, Enoch.

004:018 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
        Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

004:019 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was
        Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

004:020 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in
        tents, and of such as have cattle.

004:021 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all
        such as handle the harp and organ.

004:022 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every
        artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was
        Naamah.

004:023 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my
        voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have
        slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

004:024 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
        sevenfold.

004:025 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called
        his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another
        seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

004:026 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called
        his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the
        LORD.

005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that
        God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;

005:002 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called
        their name Adam, in the day when they were created.

005:003 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in
        his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name
        Seth:

005:004 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight
        hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:

005:005 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty
        years: and he died.

005:006 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:

005:007 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven
        years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:008 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years:
        and he died.

005:009 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:

005:010 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen
        years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:011 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and
        he died.

005:012 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:

005:013 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and
        forty years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:014 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years:
        and he died.

005:015 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:

005:016 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and
        thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:017 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and
        five years: and he died.

005:018 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat
        Enoch:

005:019 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and
        begat sons and daughters:

005:020 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two
        years: and he died.

005:021 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:

005:022 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three
        hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:023 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five
        years:

005:024 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.

005:025 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and
        begat Lamech.

005:026 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred
        eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:027 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and
        nine years: and he died.

005:028 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a
        son:

005:029 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort
        us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the
        ground which the LORD hath cursed.

005:030 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and
        five years, and begat sons and daughters:

005:031 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and
        seven years: and he died.

005:032 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,
        and Japheth.

006:001 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of
        the earth, and daughters were born unto them,

006:002 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
        fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

006:003 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,
        for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred
        and twenty years.

006:004 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after
        that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men,
        and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men
        which were of old, men of renown.

006:005 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
        and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was
        only evil continually.

006:006 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth,
        and it grieved him at his heart.

006:007 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from
        the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping
        thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I
        have made them.

006:008 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

006:009 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and
        perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.

006:010 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

006:011 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was
        filled with violence.

006:012 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt;
        for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

006:013 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before
        me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and,
        behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

006:014 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
        ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

006:015 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The
        length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth
        of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

006:016 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
        finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the
        side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou
        make it.

006:017 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
        earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life,
        from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall
        die.

006:018 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt
        come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy
        sons' wives with thee.

006:019 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort
        shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee;
        they shall be male and female.

006:020 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
        every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every
        sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.

006:021 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou
        shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee,
        and for them.

006:022 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
        he.

007:001 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into
        the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this
        generation.

007:002 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the
        male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two,
        the male and his female.

007:003 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female;
        to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

007:004 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
        forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I
        have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.

007:005 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.

007:006 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters
        was upon the earth.

007:007 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
        wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the
        flood.

007:008 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of
        fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

007:009 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and
        the female, as God had commanded Noah.

007:010 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
        flood were upon the earth.

007:011 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
        the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the
        fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of
        heaven were opened.

007:012 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

007:013 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and
        Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three
        wives of his sons with them, into the ark;

007:014 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after
        their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
        earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every
        bird of every sort.

007:015 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
        flesh, wherein is the breath of life.

007:016 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,
        as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.

007:017 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
        increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the
        earth.

007:018 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
        earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

007:019 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all
        the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were
        covered.

007:020 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the
        mountains were covered.

007:021 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,
        and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that
        creepeth upon the earth, and every man:

007:022 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was
        in the dry land, died.

007:023 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the
        face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping
        things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed
        from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that
        were with him in the ark.

007:024 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
        days.

008:001 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
        cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to
        pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;

008:002 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were
        stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

008:003 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and
        after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were
        abated.

008:004 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth
        day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

008:005 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in
        the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops
        of the mountains seen.

008:006 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened
        the window of the ark which he had made:

008:007 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until
        the waters were dried up from off the earth.

008:008 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
        abated from off the face of the ground;

008:009 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she
        returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the
        face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took
        her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

008:010 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth
        the dove out of the ark;

008:011 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her
        mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the
        waters were abated from off the earth.

008:012 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
        which returned not again unto him any more.

008:013 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in
        the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were
        dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of
        the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was
        dry.

008:014 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
        month, was the earth dried.

008:015 And God spake unto Noah, saying,

008:016 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy
        sons' wives with thee.

008:017 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of
        all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping
        thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed
        abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon
        the earth.

008:018 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
        wives with him:

008:019 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and
        whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went
        forth out of the ark.

008:020 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every
        clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
        offerings on the altar.

008:021 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
        heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's
        sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his
        youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living,
        as I have done.

008:022 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
        heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not
        cease.

009:001 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
        fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

009:002 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every
        beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all
        that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the
        sea; into your hand are they delivered.

009:003 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as
        the green herb have I given you all things.

009:004 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof,
        shall ye not eat.

009:005 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the
        hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man;
        at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of
        man.

009:006 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed:
        for in the image of God made he man.

009:007 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly
        in the earth, and multiply therein.

009:008 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

009:009 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your
        seed after you;

009:010 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl,
        of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from
        all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

009:011 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all
        flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither
        shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

009:012 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
        between me and you and every living creature that is with you,
        for perpetual generations:

009:013 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
        covenant between me and the earth.

009:014 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the
        earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

009:015 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you
        and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall
        no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

009:016 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,
        that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and
        every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

009:017 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant,
        which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon
        the earth.

009:018 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,
        and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

009:019 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole
        earth overspread.

009:020 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

009:021 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was
        uncovered within his tent.

009:022 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his
        father, and told his two brethren without.

009:023 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both
        their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness
        of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw
        not their father's nakedness.

009:024 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son
        had done unto him.

009:025 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he
        be unto his brethren.

009:026 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall
        be his servant.

009:027 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
        Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

009:028 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

009:029 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years:
        and he died.

010:001 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,
        and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

010:002 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan,
        and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

010:003 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

010:004 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and
        Dodanim.

010:005 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their
        lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in
        their nations.

010:006 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

010:007 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and
        Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and
        Dedan.

010:008 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the
        earth.

010:009 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,
        Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

010:010 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
        Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

010:011 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and
        the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

010:012 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

010:013 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and
        Naphtuhim,

010:014 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
        Caphtorim.

010:015 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,

010:016 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

010:017 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

010:018 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and
        afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

010:019 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou
        comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and
        Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

010:020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
        tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

010:021 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the
        brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

010:022 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,
        and Aram.

010:023 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

010:024 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

010:025 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg;
        for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name
        was Joktan.

010:026 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
        Jerah,

010:027 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

010:028 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

010:029 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of
        Joktan.

010:030 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a
        mount of the east.

010:031 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
        tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

010:032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
        generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations
        divided in the earth after the flood.

011:001 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

011:002 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that
        they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt
        there.

011:003 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and
        burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime
        had they for morter.

011:004 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,
        whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name,
        lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

011:005 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which
        the children of men builded.

011:006 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have
        all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing
        will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

011:007 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
        they may not understand one another's speech.

011:008 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
        all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

011:009 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
        there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence
        did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
        earth.

011:010 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
        old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

011:011 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and
        begat sons and daughters.

011:012 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

011:013 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:014 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

011:015 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:016 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

011:017 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:018 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

011:019 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years,
        and begat sons and daughters.

011:020 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

011:021 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:022 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

011:023 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and
        begat sons and daughters.

011:024 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

011:025 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen
        years, and begat sons and daughters.

011:026 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
        Haran.

011:027 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
        Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

011:028 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
        nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

011:029 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
        was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter
        of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

011:031 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his
        son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's
        wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,
        to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and
        dwelt there.

011:032 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and
        Terah died in Haran.

012:001 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
        and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land
        that I will shew thee:

012:002 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,
        and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

012:003 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that
        curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be
        blessed.

012:004 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot
        went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when
        he departed out of Haran.

012:005 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and
        all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that
        they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the
        land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.

012:006 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem,
        unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the
        land.

012:007 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will
        I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD,
        who appeared unto him.

012:008 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of
        Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and
        Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD,
        and called upon the name of the LORD.

012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

012:010 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
        Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the
        land.

012:011 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into
        Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know
        that thou art a fair woman to look upon:

012:012 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see
        thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will
        kill me, but they will save thee alive.

012:013 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
        me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
        Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

012:015 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
        Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

012:016 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,
        and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and
        she asses, and camels.

012:017 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
        because of Sarai Abram's wife.

012:018 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
        done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy
        wife?

012:019 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her
        to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go
        thy way.

012:020 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent
        him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

013:001 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that
        he had, and Lot with him, into the south.

013:002 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

013:003 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel,
        unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning,
        between Bethel and Hai;

013:004 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the
        first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.

013:005 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,
        and tents.

013:006 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
        together: for their substance was great, so that they could
        not dwell together.

013:007 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle
        and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the
        Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

013:008 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
        between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;
        for we be brethren.

013:009 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray
        thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go
        to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will
        go to the left.

013:010 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of
        Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD
        destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD,
        like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.

013:011 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
        east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

013:012 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
        cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

013:013 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
        exceedingly.

013:014 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated
        from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place
        where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and
        westward:

013:015 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and
        to thy seed for ever.

013:016 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if
        a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed
        also be numbered.

013:017 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
        breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

013:018 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain
        of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto
        the LORD.

014:001 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
        Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal
        king of nations;

014:002 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha
        king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of
        Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

014:003 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
        the salt sea.

014:004 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth
        year they rebelled.

014:005 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings
        that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth
        Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh
        Kiriathaim,

014:006 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by
        the wilderness.

014:007 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
        smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the
        Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.

014:008 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of
        Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and
        the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle
        with them in the vale of Siddim;

014:009 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of
        nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of
        Ellasar; four kings with five.

014:010 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
        Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that
        remained fled to the mountain.

014:011 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all
        their victuals, and went their way.

014:012 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,
        and his goods, and departed.

014:013 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the
        Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite,
        brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were
        confederate with Abram.

014:014 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
        armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three
        hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

014:015 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by
        night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is
        on the left hand of Damascus.

014:016 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
        brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the
        people.

014:017 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return
        from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were
        with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

014:018 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:
        and he was the priest of the most high God.

014:019 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most
        high God, possessor of heaven and earth:

014:020 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine
        enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

014:021 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons,
        and take the goods to thyself.

014:022 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
        unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and
        earth,

014:023 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
        that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou
        shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

014:024 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion
        of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let
        them take their portion.

015:001 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a
        vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy
        exceeding great reward.

015:002 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
        childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of
        Damascus?

015:003 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and,
        lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

015:004 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
        shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of
        thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

015:005 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
        heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them:
        and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

015:006 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
        righteousness.

015:007 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of
        Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

015:008 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall
        inherit it?

015:009 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,
        and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years
        old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

015:010 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
        and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided
        he not.

015:011 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove
        them away.

015:012 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
        and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

015:013 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall
        be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve
        them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;

015:014 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and
        afterward shall they come out with great substance.

015:015 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be
        buried in a good old age.

015:016 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for
        the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

015:017 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
        dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed
        between those pieces.

015:018 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
        Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt
        unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

015:019 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

015:020 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

015:021 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and
        the Jebusites.

016:001 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an
        handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

016:002 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath
        restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid;
        it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram
        hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

016:003 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after
        Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her
        to her husband Abram to be his wife.

016:004 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw
        that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

016:005 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given
        my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had
        conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between
        me and thee.

016:006 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand;
        do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly
        with her, she fled from her face.

016:007 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in
        the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and
        whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my
        mistress Sarai.

016:009 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy
        mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

016:010 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy
        seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

016:011 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with
        child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael;
        because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.

016:012 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,
        and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the
        presence of all his brethren.

016:013 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou
        God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him
        that seeth me?

016:014 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is
        between Kadesh and Bered.

016:015 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,
        which Hagar bare, Ishmael.

016:016 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare
        Ishmael to Abram.

017:001 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD
        appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God;
        walk before me, and be thou perfect.

017:002 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will
        multiply thee exceedingly.

017:003 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

017:004 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be
        a father of many nations.

017:005 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name
        shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made
        thee.

017:006 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make
        nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

017:007 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy
        seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting
        covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

017:008 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the
        land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for
        an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

017:009 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant
        therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

017:010 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you
        and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be
        circumcised.

017:011 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it
        shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

017:012 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,
        every man child in your generations, he that is born in the
        house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of
        thy seed.

017:013 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy
        money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in
        your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

017:014 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is
        not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people;
        he hath broken my covenant.

017:015 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt
        not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

017:016 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I
        will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of
        people shall be of her.

017:017 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
        heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years
        old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

017:018 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before
        thee!

017:019 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and
        thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my
        covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his
        seed after him.

017:020 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed
        him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him
        exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make
        him a great nation.

017:021 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall
        bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

017:022 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from
        Abraham.

017:023 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in
        his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male
        among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of
        their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

017:024 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was
        circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

017:025 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was
        circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

017:026 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
        son.

017:027 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought
        with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

018:001 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he
        sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

018:002 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood
        by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the
        tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,

018:003 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight,
        pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

018:004 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your
        feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

018:005 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your
        hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come
        to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

018:006 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
        ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make
        cakes upon the hearth.

018:007 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and
        good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had
        dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under
        the tree, and they did eat.

018:009 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
        Behold, in the tent.

018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to
        the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
        And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.

018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and
        it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

018:012 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am
        waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

018:013 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
        saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

018:014 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I
        will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and
        Sarah shall have a son.

018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
        And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

018:016 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
        Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

018:017 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which
        I do;

018:018 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
        nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in
        him?

018:019 For I know him, that he will command his children and his
        household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,
        to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon
        Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

018:020 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
        great, and because their sin is very grievous;

018:021 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
        according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,
        I will know.

018:022 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
        Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

018:023 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
        righteous with the wicked?

018:024 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt
        thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty
        righteous that are therein?

018:025 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the
        righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as
        the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all
        the earth do right?

018:026 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within
        the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

018:027 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon
        me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:

018:028 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
        wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,
        If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.

018:029 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there
        shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for
        forty's sake.

018:030 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
        speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he
        said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.

018:031 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto
        the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And
        he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

018:032 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak
        yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And
        he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.

018:033 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing
        with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

019:001 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
        gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and
        he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;

019:002 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into
        your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,
        and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they
        said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

019:003 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
        and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did
        bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of
        Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the
        people from every quarter:

019:005 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men
        which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that
        we may know them.

019:006 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door
        after him,

019:007 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

019:008 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let
        me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as
        is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for
        therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.

019:009 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one
        fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now
        will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed
        sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.

019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the
        house to them, and shut to the door.

019:011 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
        blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied
        themselves to find the door.

019:012 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
        law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast
        in the city, bring them out of this place:

019:013 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is
        waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath
        sent us to destroy it.

019:014 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which
        married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this
        place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as
        one that mocked unto his sons in law.

019:015 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
        saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are
        here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

019:016 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and
        upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two
        daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought
        him forth, and set him without the city.

019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
        that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,
        neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,
        lest thou be consumed.

019:018 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:

019:019 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and
        thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me
        in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest
        some evil take me, and I die:

019:020 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little
        one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and
        my soul shall live.

019:021 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning
        this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the
        which thou hast spoken.

019:022 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou
        be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called
        Zoar.

019:023 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

019:024 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone
        and fire from the LORD out of heaven;

019:025 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
        inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the
        ground.

019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
        pillar of salt.

019:027 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
        stood before the LORD:

019:028 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the
        land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the
        country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

019:029 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the
        plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the
        midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the
        which Lot dwelt.

019:030 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and
        his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar:
        and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

019:031 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,
        and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after
        the manner of all the earth:

019:032 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with
        him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

019:033 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the
        firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived
        not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said
        unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:
        let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,
        and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

019:035 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
        younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she
        lay down, nor when she arose.

019:036 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their
        father.

019:037 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the
        same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

019:038 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name
        Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto
        this day.

020:001 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,
        and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

020:002 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and
        Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to
        him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou
        hast taken; for she is a man's wife.

020:004 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt
        thou slay also a righteous nation?

020:005 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she
        herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart
        and innocency of my hands have I done this.

020:006 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
        this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee
        from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to
        touch her.

020:007 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,
        and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou
        restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,
        and all that are thine.

020:008 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all
        his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the
        men were sore afraid.

020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast
        thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou
        hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast
        done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.

020:010 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou
        hast done this thing?

020:011 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is
        not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

020:012 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my
        father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my
        wife.

020:013 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
        father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness
        which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall
        come, say of me, He is my brother.

020:014 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
        womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him
        Sarah his wife.

020:015 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell
        where it pleaseth thee.

020:016 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a
        thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of
        the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other:
        thus she was reproved.

020:017 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his
        wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.

020:018 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
        Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

021:001 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did
        unto Sarah as he had spoken.

021:002 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at
        the set time of which God had spoken to him.

021:003 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,
        whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

021:004 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as
        God had commanded him.

021:005 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was
        born unto him.

021:006 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that
        hear will laugh with me.

021:007 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah
        should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in
        his old age.

021:008 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great
        feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.

021:009 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had
        born unto Abraham, mocking.

021:010 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and
        her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with
        my son, even with Isaac.

021:011 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of
        his son.

021:012 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
        because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that
        Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in
        Isaac shall thy seed be called.

021:013 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
        because he is thy seed.

021:014 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and
        a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her
        shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed,
        and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

021:015 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
        under one of the shrubs.

021:016 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way
        off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the
        death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up
        her voice, and wept.

021:017 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God
        called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth
        thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad
        where he is.

021:018 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will
        make him a great nation.

021:019 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
        went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad
        drink.

021:020 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
        wilderness, and became an archer.

021:021 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took
        him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

021:022 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol
        the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God
        is with thee in all that thou doest:

021:023 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not
        deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son:
        but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou
        shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

021:024 And Abraham said, I will swear.

021:025 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,
        which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

021:026 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;
        neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to
        day.

021:027 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
        and both of them made a covenant.

021:028 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

021:029 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe
        lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

021:030 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my
        hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged
        this well.

021:031 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they
        sware both of them.

021:032 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose
        up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they
        returned into the land of the Philistines.

021:033 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on
        the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

021:034 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

022:001 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
        Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here
        I am.

022:002 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
        lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him
        there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I
        will tell thee of.

022:003 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
        and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and
        clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went
        unto the place of which God had told him.

022:004 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
        place afar off.

022:005 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the
        ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come
        again to you.

022:006 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it
        upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a
        knife; and they went both of them together.

022:007 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:
        and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire
        and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

022:008 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for
        a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.

022:009 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and
        Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and
        bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

022:010 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to
        slay his son.

022:011 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and
        said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.

022:012 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
        any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God,
        seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

022:013 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
        him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went
        and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in
        the stead of his son.

022:014 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it
        is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be
        seen.

022:015 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven
        the second time,

022:016 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because
        thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,
        thine only son:

022:017 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
        multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
        which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the
        gate of his enemies;

022:018 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
        because thou hast obeyed my voice.

022:019 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and
        went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

022:020 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told
        Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children
        unto thy brother Nahor;

022:021 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father
        of Aram,

022:022 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

022:023 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to
        Nahor, Abraham's brother.

022:024 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,
        and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

023:001 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these
        were the years of the life of Sarah.

023:002 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land
        of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep
        for her.

023:003 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
        sons of Heth, saying,

023:004 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession
        of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my
        sight.

023:005 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,

023:006 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the
        choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall
        withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury
        thy dead.

023:007 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the
        land, even to the children of Heth.

023:008 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I
        should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for
        me to Ephron the son of Zohar,

023:009 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath,
        which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is
        worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace
        amongst you.

023:010 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the
        Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of
        Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city,
        saying,

023:011 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave
        that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons
        of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.

023:012 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

023:013 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
        land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me:
        I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I
        will bury my dead there.

023:014 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

023:015 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred
        shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury
        therefore thy dead.

023:016 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to
        Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the
        sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money
        with the merchant.

023:017 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was
        before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and
        all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the
        borders round about, were made sure

023:018 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children
        of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

023:019 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of
        the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the
        land of Canaan.

023:020 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure
        unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of
        Heth.

024:001 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD
        had blessed Abraham in all things.

024:002 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that
        ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under
        my thigh:

024:003 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and
        the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my
        son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:

024:004 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take
        a wife unto my son Isaac.

024:005 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not
        be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy
        son again unto the land from whence thou camest?

024:006 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my
        son thither again.

024:007 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,
        and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and
        that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this
        land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take
        a wife unto my son from thence.

024:008 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
        shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son
        thither again.

024:009 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
        master, and sware to him concerning that matter.

024:010 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,
        and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his
        hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of
        Nahor.

024:011 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a
        well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that
        women go out to draw water.

024:012 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send
        me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master
        Abraham.

024:013 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters
        of the men of the city come out to draw water:

024:014 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,
        Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she
        shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let
        the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant
        Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness
        unto my master.

024:015 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that,
        behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of
        Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher
        upon her shoulder.

024:016 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither
        had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and
        filled her pitcher, and came up.

024:017 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray
        thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.

024:018 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
        pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

024:019 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
        water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

024:020 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and
        ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his
        camels.

024:021 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether
        the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.

024:022 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the
        man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two
        bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;

024:023 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is
        there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

024:024 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of
        Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

024:025 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
        enough, and room to lodge in.

024:026 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.

024:027 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who
        hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth:
        I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my
        master's brethren.

024:028 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these
        things.

024:029 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban
        ran out unto the man, unto the well.

024:030 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets
        upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of
        Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that
        he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at
        the well.

024:031 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore
        standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room
        for the camels.

024:032 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels,
        and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash
        his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.

024:033 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will
        not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

024:034 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

024:035 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become
        great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver,
        and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and
        asses.

024:036 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she
        was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

024:037 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a
        wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose
        land I dwell:

024:038 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred,
        and take a wife unto my son.

024:039 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not
        follow me.

024:040 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send
        his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take
        a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:

024:041 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest
        to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be
        clear from my oath.

024:042 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my
        master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:

024:043 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to
        pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I
        say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy
        pitcher to drink;

024:044 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for
        thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath
        appointed out for my master's son.

024:045 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah
        came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down
        unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me
        drink, I pray thee.

024:046 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her
        shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink
        also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

024:047 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
        said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare
        unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the
        bracelets upon her hands.

024:048 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed
        the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the
        right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

024:049 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell
        me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or
        to the left.

024:050 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth
        from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

024:051 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her
        be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.

024:052 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their
        words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.

024:053 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of
        gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to
        her brother and to her mother precious things.

024:054 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,
        and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he
        said, Send me away unto my master.

024:055 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with
        us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.

024:056 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath
        prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

024:057 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her
        mouth.

024:058 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with
        this man? And she said, I will go.

024:059 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
        Abraham's servant, and his men.

024:060 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our
        sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let
        thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.

024:061 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the
        camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah,
        and went his way.

024:062 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt
        in the south country.

024:063 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:
        and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels
        were coming.

024:064 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she
        lighted off the camel.

024:065 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that
        walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It
        is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

024:066 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

024:067 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
        Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac
        was comforted after his mother's death.

025:001 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

025:002 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian,
        and Ishbak, and Shuah.

025:003 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
        Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

025:004 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and
        Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

025:005 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

025:006 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had,
        Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son,
        while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.

025:007 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he
        lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

025:008 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an
        old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

025:009 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
        Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the
        Hittite, which is before Mamre;

025:010 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there
        was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

025:011 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God
        blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

025:012 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom
        Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

025:013 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their
        names, according to their generations: the firstborn of
        Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

025:014 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

025:015 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

025:016 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by
        their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to
        their nations.

025:017 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
        thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and
        was gathered unto his people.

025:018 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt,
        as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of
        all his brethren.

025:019 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham
        begat Isaac:

025:020 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife,
        the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to
        Laban the Syrian.

025:021 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was
        barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his
        wife conceived.

025:022 And the children struggled together within her; and she said,
        If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the
        LORD.

025:023 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and
        two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and
        the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and
        the elder shall serve the younger.

025:024 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,
        there were twins in her womb.

025:025 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment;
        and they called his name Esau.

025:026 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
        Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was
        threescore years old when she bare them.

025:027 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
        field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

025:028 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but
        Rebekah loved Jacob.

025:029 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he
        was faint:

025:030 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same
        red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called
        Edom.

025:031 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

025:032 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what
        profit shall this birthright do to me?

025:033 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him:
        and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

025:034 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did
        eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau
        despised his birthright.

026:001 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine
        that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech
        king of the Philistines unto Gerar.

026:002 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into
        Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:

026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless
        thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these
        countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto
        Abraham thy father;

026:004 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,
        and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy
        seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;

026:005 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
        commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

026:006 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:

026:007 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said,
        She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest,
        said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah;
        because she was fair to look upon.

026:008 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
        Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and
        saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

026:009 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she
        is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac
        said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.

026:010 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one
        of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou
        shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.

026:011 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth
        this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

026:012 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year
        an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.

026:013 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he
        became very great:

026:014 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and
        great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.

026:015 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in
        the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped
        them, and filled them with earth.

026:016 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
        mightier than we.

026:017 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley
        of Gerar, and dwelt there.

026:018 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had
        digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines
        had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called
        their names after the names by which his father had called
        them.

026:019 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a
        well of springing water.

026:020 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,
        saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well
        Esek; because they strove with him.

026:021 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
        called the name of it Sitnah.

026:022 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for
        that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth;
        and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we
        shall be fruitful in the land.

026:023 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

026:024 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am
        the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,
        and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant
        Abraham's sake.

026:025 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
        LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants
        digged a well.

026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
        friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

026:027 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye
        hate me, and have sent me away from you?

026:028 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee:
        and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt
        us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;

026:029 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and
        as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee
        away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.

026:030 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

026:031 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to
        another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him
        in peace.

026:032 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,
        and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and
        said unto him, We have found water.

026:033 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is
        Beersheba unto this day.

026:034 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
        daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of
        Elon the Hittite:

026:035 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

027:001 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes
        were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest
        son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,
        here am I.

027:002 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my
        death:

027:003 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and
        thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;

027:004 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me,
        that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

027:005 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau
        went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

027:006 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard
        thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

027:007 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat,
        and bless thee before the LORD before my death.

027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
        command thee.

027:009 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of
        the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,
        such as he loveth:

027:010 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and
        that he may bless thee before his death.

027:011 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother
        is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:

027:012 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him
        as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a
        blessing.

027:013 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:
        only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

027:014 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and
        his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.

027:015 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
        were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her
        younger son:

027:016 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,
        and upon the smooth of his neck:

027:017 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had
        prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

027:018 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,
        Here am I; who art thou, my son?

027:019 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I
        have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit
        and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

027:020 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it
        so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God
        brought it to me.

027:021 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may
        feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

027:022 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him,
        and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the
        hands of Esau.

027:023 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
        brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.

027:024 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

027:025 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's
        venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near
        to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.

027:026 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss
        me, my son.

027:027 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of
        his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my
        son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:

027:028 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness
        of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

027:029 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord
        over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:
        cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that
        blesseth thee.

027:030 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of
        blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the
        presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in
        from his hunting.

027:031 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his
        father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat
        of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

027:032 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said,
        I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

027:033 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is
        he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have
        eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,
        and he shall be blessed.

027:034 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a
        great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father,
        Bless me, even me also, O my father.

027:035 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken
        away thy blessing.

027:036 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath
        supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright;
        and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said,
        Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

027:037 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him
        thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for
        servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and
        what shall I do now unto thee, my son?

027:038 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my
        father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted
        up his voice, and wept.

027:039 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
        dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of
        heaven from above;

027:040 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;
        and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion,
        that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

027:041 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his
        father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of
        mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my
        brother Jacob.

027:042 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:
        and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto
        him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort
        himself, purposing to kill thee.

027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to
        Laban my brother to Haran;

027:044 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn
        away;

027:045 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget
        that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch
        thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in
        one day?

027:046 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of
        the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters
        of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land,
        what good shall my life do me?

028:001 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and
        said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of
        Canaan.

028:002 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's
        father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of
        Laban thy mother's brother.

028:003 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and
        multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;

028:004 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy
        seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou
        art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.

028:005 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto
        Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,
        Jacob's and Esau's mother.

028:006 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away
        to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he
        blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take
        a wife of the daughers of Canaan;

028:007 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone
        to Padanaram;

028:008 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac
        his father;

028:009 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he
        had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister
        of Nebajoth, to be his wife.

028:010 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

028:011 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all
        night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of
        that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that
        place to sleep.

028:012 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and
        the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God
        ascending and descending on it.

028:013 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD
        God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land
        whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;

028:014 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt
        spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,
        and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the
        families of the earth be blessed.

028:015 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
        whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land;
        for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have
        spoken to thee of.

028:016 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the
        LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.

028:017 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this
        is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of
        heaven.

028:018 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone
        that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar,
        and poured oil upon the top of it.

028:019 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of
        that city was called Luz at the first.

028:020 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and
        will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to
        eat, and raiment to put on,

028:021 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall
        the LORD be my God:

028:022 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's
        house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give
        the tenth unto thee.

029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
        people of the east.

029:002 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
        were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well
        they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's
        mouth.

029:003 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the
        stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put
        the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.

029:004 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they
        said, Of Haran are we.

029:005 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And
        they said, We know him.

029:006 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:
        and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

029:007 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that
        the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep,
        and go and feed them.

029:008 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
        together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth;
        then we water the sheep.

029:009 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her
        father's sheep; for she kept them.

029:010 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of
        Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his
        mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone
        from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his
        mother's brother.

029:011 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

029:012 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and
        that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.

029:013 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
        sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and
        kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban
        all these things.

029:014 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.
        And he abode with him the space of a month.

029:015 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,
        shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what
        shall thy wages be?

029:016 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah,
        and the name of the younger was Rachel.

029:017 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well
        favoured.

029:018 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven
        years for Rachel thy younger daughter.

029:019 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than
        that I should give her to another man: abide with me.

029:020 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto
        him but a few days, for the love he had to her.

029:021 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
        fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

029:022 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made
        a feast.

029:023 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
        daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

029:024 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
        handmaid.

029:025 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:
        and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did
        not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou
        beguiled me?

029:026 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give
        the younger before the firstborn.

029:027 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the
        service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

029:028 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him
        Rachel his daughter to wife also.

029:029 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to
        be her maid.

029:030 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more
        than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

029:031 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:
        but Rachel was barren.

029:032 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name
        Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my
        affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.

029:033 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the
        LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this
        son also: and she called his name Simeon.

029:034 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this
        time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born
        him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.

029:035 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now
        will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah;
        and left bearing.

030:001 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel
        envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or
        else I die.

030:002 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am
        I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the
        womb?

030:003 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she
        shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by
        her.

030:004 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went
        in unto her.

030:005 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.

030:006 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my
        voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name
        Dan.

030:007 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a
        second son.

030:008 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
        sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name
        Naphtali.

030:009 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her
        maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.

030:010 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.

030:011 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.

030:012 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.

030:013 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me
        blessed: and she called his name Asher.

030:014 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found
        mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.
        Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's
        mandrakes.

030:015 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast
        taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's
        mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with
        thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.

030:016 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went
        out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for
        surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay
        with her that night.

030:017 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob
        the fifth son.

030:018 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given
        my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.

030:019 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.

030:020 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will
        my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons:
        and she called his name Zebulun.

030:021 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

030:022 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and
        opened her womb.

030:023 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken
        away my reproach:

030:024 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add
        to me another son.

030:025 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob
        said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own
        place, and to my country.

030:026 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,
        and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done
        thee.

030:027 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour
        in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that
        the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.

030:028 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

030:029 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and
        how thy cattle was with me.

030:030 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is
        now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee
        since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own
        house also?

030:031 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou
        shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for
        me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.

030:032 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence
        all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle
        among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats:
        and of such shall be my hire.

030:033 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when
        it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is
        not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the
        sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

030:034 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy
        word.

030:035 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
        spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,
        and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown
        among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

030:036 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and
        Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

030:037 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
        chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the
        white appear which was in the rods.

030:038 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in
        the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to
        drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.

030:039 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth
        cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

030:040 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the
        flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock
        of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put
        them not unto Laban's cattle.

030:041 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did
        conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the
        cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the
        rods.

030:042 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the
        feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

030:043 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
        maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

031:001 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath
        taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was
        our father's hath he gotten all this glory.

031:002 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was
        not toward him as before.

031:003 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy
        fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

031:004 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto
        his flock,

031:005 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it
        is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been
        with me.

031:006 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

031:007 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten
        times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.

031:008 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the
        cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked
        shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

031:009 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
        them to me.

031:010 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived,
        that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold,
        the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked,
        speckled, and grisled.

031:011 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:
        And I said, Here am I.

031:012 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams
        which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and
        grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

031:013 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and
        where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from
        this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.

031:014 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet
        any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

031:015 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and
        hath quite devoured also our money.

031:016 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that
        is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath
        said unto thee, do.

031:017 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon
        camels;

031:018 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he
        had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in
        Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of
        Canaan.

031:019 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the
        images that were her father's.

031:020 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he
        told him not that he fled.

031:021 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed
        over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

031:022 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

031:023 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven
        days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

031:024 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said
        unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good
        or bad.

031:025 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in
        the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of
        Gilead.

031:026 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast
        stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as
        captives taken with the sword?

031:027 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from
        me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away
        with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?

031:028 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?
        thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.

031:029 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of
        your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed
        that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

031:030 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
        longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou
        stolen my gods?

031:031 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:
        for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy
        daughters from me.

031:032 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:
        before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and
        take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen
        them.

031:033 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and
        into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then
        went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

031:034 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's
        furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,
        but found them not.

031:035 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that
        I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon
        me. And he searched but found not the images.

031:036 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
        and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that
        thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

031:037 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found
        of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and
        thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

031:038 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she
        goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock
        have I not eaten.

031:039 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare
        the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether
        stolen by day, or stolen by night.

031:040 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost
        by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

031:041 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee
        fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy
        cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

031:042 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear
        of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now
        empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my
        hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.

031:043 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
        daughters, and these children are my children, and these
        cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and
        what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their
        children which they have born?

031:044 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;
        and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

031:045 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

031:046 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
        stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the
        heap.

031:047 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it
        Galeed.

031:048 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee
        this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;

031:049 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,
        when we are absent one from another.

031:050 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take
        other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God
        is witness betwixt me and thee.

031:051 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
        pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:

031:052 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will
        not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass
        over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their
        father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his
        father Isaac.

031:054 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his
        brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all
        night in the mount.

031:055 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons
        and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and
        returned unto his place.

032:001 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

032:002 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he
        called the name of that place Mahanaim.

032:003 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto
        the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

032:004 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my
        lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with
        Laban, and stayed there until now:

032:005 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and
        womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may
        find grace in thy sight.

032:006 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
        brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four
        hundred men with him.

032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided
        the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and
        the camels, into two bands;

032:008 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then
        the other company which is left shall escape.

032:009 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my
        father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy
        country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all
        the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with
        my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two
        bands.

032:011 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the
        hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,
        and the mother with the children.

032:012 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
        as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for
        multitude.

032:013 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which
        came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;

032:014 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,
        and twenty rams,

032:015 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten
        bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.

032:016 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every
        drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over
        before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.

032:017 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
        meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and
        whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?

032:018 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a
        present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind
        us.

032:019 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
        followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak
        unto Esau, when ye find him.

032:020 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.
        For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth
        before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he
        will accept of me.

032:021 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that
        night in the company.

032:022 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
        womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford
        Jabbok.

032:023 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
        that he had.

032:024 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him
        until the breaking of the day.

032:025 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
        the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
        out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

032:026 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
        will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

032:027 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

032:028 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but
        Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,
        and hast prevailed.

032:029 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
        And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?
        And he blessed him there.

032:030 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen
        God face to face, and my life is preserved.

032:031 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
        halted upon his thigh.

032:032 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which
        shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:
        because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew
        that shrank.

033:001 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau
        came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the
        children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two
        handmaids.

033:002 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah
        and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

033:003 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the
        ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

033:004 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his
        neck, and kissed him: and they wept.

033:005 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;
        and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children
        which God hath graciously given thy servant.

033:006 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and
        they bowed themselves.

033:007 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed
        themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they
        bowed themselves.

033:008 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?
        And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

033:009 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast
        unto thyself.

033:010 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in
        thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I
        have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and
        thou wast pleased with me.

033:011 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;
        because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have
        enough. And he urged him, and he took it.

033:012 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I
        will go before thee.

033:013 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are
        tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and
        if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

033:014 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I
        will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before
        me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my
        lord unto Seir.

033:015 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk
        that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find
        grace in the sight of my lord.

033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

033:017 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and
        made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is
        called Succoth.

033:018 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the
        land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his
        tent before the city.

033:019 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his
        tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father,
        for an hundred pieces of money.

033:020 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.

034:001 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,
        went out to see the daughters of the land.

034:002 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
        country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled
        her.

034:003 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he
        loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

034:004 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this
        damsel to wife.

034:005 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now
        his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his
        peace until they were come.

034:006 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
        with him.

034:007 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard
        it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,
        because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's
        daughter: which thing ought not to be done.

034:008 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son
        Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to
        wife.

034:009 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto
        us, and take our daughters unto you.

034:010 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;
        dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

034:011 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me
        find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will
        give.

034:012 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
        as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.

034:013 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
        deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their
        sister:

034:014 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our
        sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach
        unto us:

034:015 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,
        that every male of you be circumcised;

034:016 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take
        your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will
        become one people.

034:017 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then
        will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.

034:018 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

034:019 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
        delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than
        all the house of his father.

034:020 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their
        city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,

034:021 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in
        the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large
        enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives,
        and let us give them our daughters.

034:022 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,
        to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as
        they are circumcised.

034:023 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of
        their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will
        dwell with us.

034:024 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that
        went out of the gate of his city; and every male was
        circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.

034:025 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,
        that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's
        brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city
        boldly, and slew all the males.

034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
        sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
        because they had defiled their sister.

034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and
        that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,

034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their
        wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the
        house.

034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
        me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the
        Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they
        shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and
        I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

034:031 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an
        harlot?

035:001 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell
        there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto
        thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

035:002 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with
        him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be
        clean, and change your garments:

035:003 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there
        an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress,
        and was with me in the way which I went.

035:004 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in
        their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears;
        and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

035:005 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities
        that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the
        sons of Jacob.

035:006 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
        Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

035:007 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:
        because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the
        face of his brother.

035:008 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath
        Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called
        Allonbachuth.

035:009 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of
        Padanaram, and blessed him.

035:010 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not
        be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he
        called his name Israel.

035:011 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and
        multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee,
        and kings shall come out of thy loins;

035:012 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will
        give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

035:013 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with
        him.

035:014 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with
        him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering
        thereon, and he poured oil thereon.

035:015 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with
        him, Bethel.

035:016 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way
        to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard
        labour.

035:017 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the
        midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son
        also.

035:018 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she
        died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called
        him Benjamin.

035:019 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which
        is Bethlehem.

035:020 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of
        Rachel's grave unto this day.

035:021 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of
        Edar.

035:022 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that
        Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and
        Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

035:023 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and
        Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:

035:024 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:

035:025 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

035:026 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these
        are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

035:027 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city
        of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

035:028 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

035:029 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto
        his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and
        Jacob buried him.

036:001 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

036:002 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the
        daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of
        Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

036:003 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

036:004 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

036:005 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are
        the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of
        Canaan.

036:006 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and
        all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his
        beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of
        Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother
        Jacob.

036:007 For their riches were more than that they might dwell
        together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not
        bear them because of their cattle.

036:008 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

036:009 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the
        Edomites in mount Seir:

036:010 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah
        the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.

036:011 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam,
        and Kenaz.

036:012 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to
        Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.

036:013 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah,
        and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

036:014 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah
        the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau
        Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.

036:015 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the
        firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke
        Kenaz,

036:016 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes
        that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons
        of Adah.

036:017 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke
        Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that
        came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of
        Bashemath Esau's wife.

036:018 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush,
        duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of
        Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

036:019 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their
        dukes.

036:020 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;
        Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

036:021 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the
        Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

036:022 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's
        sister was Timna.

036:023 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath,
        and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

036:024 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah:
        this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as
        he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.

036:025 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah
        the daughter of Anah.

036:026 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and
        Ithran, and Cheran.

036:027 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.

036:028 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.

036:029 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke
        Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,

036:030 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that
        came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.

036:031 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,
        before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

036:032 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his
        city was Dinhabah.

036:033 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in
        his stead.

036:034 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in
        his stead.

036:035 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian
        in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of
        his city was Avith.

036:036 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

036:037 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in
        his stead.

036:038 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his
        stead.

036:039 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his
        stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name
        was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of
        Mezahab.

036:040 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau,
        according to their families, after their places, by their
        names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,

036:041 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,

036:042 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,

036:043 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according
        to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is
        Esau the father of the Edomites.

037:001 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger,
        in the land of Canaan.

037:002 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen
        years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the
        lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah,
        his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their
        evil report.

037:003 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he
        was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many
        colours.

037:004 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more
        than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak
        peaceably unto him.

037:005 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and
        they hated him yet the more.

037:006 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I
        have dreamed:

037:007 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my
        sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves
        stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

037:008 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us?
        or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him
        yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.

037:009 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,
        and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold,
        the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to
        me.

037:010 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his
        father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that
        thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren
        indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?

037:011 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the
        saying.

037:012 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

037:013 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the
        flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he
        said to him, Here am I.

037:014 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well
        with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word
        again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came
        to Shechem.

037:015 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in
        the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

037:016 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where
        they feed their flocks.

037:017 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them
        say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,
        and found them in Dothan.

037:018 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
        them, they conspired against him to slay him.

037:019 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.

037:020 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into
        some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him:
        and we shall see what will become of his dreams.

037:021 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
        and said, Let us not kill him.

037:022 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into
        this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;
        that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to
        his father again.

037:023 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
        that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many
        colours that was on him;

037:024 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was
        empty, there was no water in it.

037:025 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes
        and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from
        Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,
        going to carry it down to Egypt.

037:026 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay
        our brother, and conceal his blood?

037:027 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our
        hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his
        brethren were content.

037:028 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
        lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the
        Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought
        Joseph into Egypt.

037:029 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not
        in the pit; and he rent his clothes.

037:030 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;
        and I, whither shall I go?

037:031 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats,
        and dipped the coat in the blood;

037:032 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to
        their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether
        it be thy son's coat or no.

037:033 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast
        hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

037:034 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
        and mourned for his son many days.

037:035 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
        but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go
        down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept
        for him.

037:036 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an
        officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

038:001 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from
        his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose
        name was Hirah.

038:002 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose
        name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

038:003 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

038:004 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his
        name Onan.

038:005 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his
        name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

038:006 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was
        Tamar.

038:007 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the
        LORD; and the LORD slew him.

038:008 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and
        marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

038:009 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to
        pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled
        it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his
        brother.

038:010 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he
        slew him also.

038:011 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow
        at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he
        said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And
        Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.

038:012 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife
        died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his
        sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the
        Adullamite.

038:013 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth
        up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

038:014 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her
        with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,
        which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was
        grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because
        she had covered her face.

038:016 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray
        thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was
        his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me,
        that thou mayest come in unto me?

038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she
        said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy
        signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine
        hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she
        conceived by him.

038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,
        and put on the garments of her widowhood.

038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the
        Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but
        he found her not.

038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the
        harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There
        was no harlot in this place.

038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and
        also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in
        this place.

038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:
        behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
        Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the
        harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And
        Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,
        saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she
        said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and
        bracelets, and staff.

038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more
        righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my
        son. And he knew her again no more.

038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,
        twins were in her womb.

038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
        his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a
        scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,
        his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken
        forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called
        Pharez.

038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet
        thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer
        of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of
        the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down
        thither.

039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and
        he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the
        LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he
        made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put
        into his hand.

039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him
        overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD
        blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the
        blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,
        and in the field.

039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not
        ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was
        a goodly person, and well favoured.

039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife
        cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my
        master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath
        committed all that he hath to my hand;

039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he
        kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his
        wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
        God?

039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that
        he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.

039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the
        house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the
        house there within.

039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he
        left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment
        in her hand, and was fled forth,

039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto
        them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to
        mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a
        loud voice:

039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice
        and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got
        him out.

039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
        Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto
        me to mock me:

039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that
        he left his garment with me, and fled out.

039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his
        wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did
        thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.

039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a
        place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there
        in the prison.

039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave
        him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

039:022 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all
        the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did
        there, he was the doer of it.

039:023 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was
        under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which
        he did, the LORD made it to prosper.

040:001 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the
        king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king
        of Egypt.

040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the
        chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the
        guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
        served them: and they continued a season in ward.

040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in
        one night, each man according to the interpretation of his
        dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which
        were bound in the prison.

040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
        them, and, behold, they were sad.

040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward
        of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to
        day?

040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is
        no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not
        interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.

040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to
        him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;

040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it
        budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof
        brought forth ripe grapes:

040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and
        pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into
        Pharaoh's hand.

040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:
        The three branches are three days:

040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and
        restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's
        cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his
        butler.

040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
        kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto
        Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:

040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:
        and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into
        the dungeon.

040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he
        said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had
        three white baskets on my head:

040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of
        bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the
        basket upon my head.

040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
        thereof: The three baskets are three days:

040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off
        thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat
        thy flesh from off thee.

040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's
        birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he
        lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker
        among his servants.

040:021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;
        and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:

040:022 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to
        them.

040:023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

041:001 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
        dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

041:002 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well
        favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

041:003 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
        river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other
        kine upon the brink of the river.

041:004 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
        well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

041:005 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven
        ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

041:006 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
        sprung up after them.

041:007 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
        And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

041:008 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was
        troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of
        Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his
        dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto
        Pharaoh.

041:009 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do
        remember my faults this day:

041:010 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
        captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:

041:011 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each
        man according to the interpretation of his dream.

041:012 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to
        the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted
        to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did
        interpret.

041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
        restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him
        hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed
        his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.

041:015 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and
        there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of
        thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

041:016 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God
        shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

041:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood
        upon the bank of the river:

041:018 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,
        fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

041:019 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and
        very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all
        the land of Egypt for badness:

041:020 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first
        seven fat kine:

041:021 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that
        they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at
        the beginning. So I awoke.

041:022 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one
        stalk, full and good:

041:023 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the
        east wind, sprung up after them:

041:024 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told
        this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare
        it to me.

041:025 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
        hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.

041:026 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears
        are seven years: the dream is one.

041:027 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after
        them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with
        the east wind shall be seven years of famine.

041:028 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God
        is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
        the land of Egypt:

041:030 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and
        all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and
        the famine shall consume the land;

041:031 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of
        that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.

041:032 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
        because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly
        bring it to pass.

041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,
        and set him over the land of Egypt.

041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the
        land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the
        seven plenteous years.

041:035 And let them gather all the food of those good years that
        come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them
        keep food in the cities.

041:036 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
        years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the
        land perish not through the famine.

041:037 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
        of all his servants.

041:038 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as
        this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

041:039 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed
        thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:

041:040 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall
        all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater
        than thou.

041:041 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all
        the land of Egypt.

041:042 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
        Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and
        put a gold chain about his neck;

041:043 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had;
        and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler
        over all the land of Egypt.

041:044 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee
        shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of
        Egypt.

041:045 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave
        him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.
        And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.

041:046 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh
        king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of
        Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

041:047 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
        handfuls.

041:048 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were
        in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the
        food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he
        up in the same.

041:049 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
        until he left numbering; for it was without number.

041:050 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine
        came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On
        bare unto him.

041:051 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,
        said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's
        house.

041:052 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath
        caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

041:053 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of
        Egypt, were ended.

041:054 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as
        Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all
        the land of Egypt there was bread.

041:055 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried
        to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians,
        Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

041:056 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph
        opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and
        the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

041:057 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;
        because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

042:001 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said
        unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

042:002 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:
        get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may
        live, and not die.

042:003 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

042:004 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his
        brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

042:005 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:
        for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

042:006 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that
        sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren
        came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to
        the earth.

042:007 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made
        himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he
        said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land
        of Canaan to buy food.

042:008 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

042:009 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and
        said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land
        ye are come.

042:010 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
        servants come.

042:011 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are
        no spies.

042:012 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the
        land ye are come.

042:013 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of
        one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is
        this day with our father, and one is not.

042:014 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,
        saying, Ye are spies:

042:015 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not
        go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

042:016 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall
        be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether
        there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh
        surely ye are spies.

042:017 And he put them all together into ward three days.

042:018 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;
        for I fear God:

042:019 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the
        house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your
        houses:

042:020 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words
        be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

042:021 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
        our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he
        besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress
        come upon us.

042:022 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you,
        saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?
        therefore, behold, also his blood is required.

042:023 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake
        unto them by an interpreter.

042:024 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned
        to them again, and communed with them, and took from them
        Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

042:025 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to
        restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them
        provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.

042:026 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

042:027 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender
        in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his
        sack's mouth.

042:028 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,
        it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they
        were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath
        done unto us?

042:029 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,
        and told him all that befell unto them; saying,

042:030 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and
        took us for spies of the country.

042:031 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:

042:032 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the
        youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

042:033 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby
        shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren
        here with me, and take food for the famine of your households,
        and be gone:

042:034 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know
        that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I
        deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,
        every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both
        they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were
        afraid.

042:036 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of
        my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will
        take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.

042:037 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if
        I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will
        bring him to thee again.

042:038 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his
        brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him
        by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my
        gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

043:001 And the famine was sore in the land.

043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which
        they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go
        again, buy us a little food.

043:003 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
        unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
        be with you.

043:004 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
        thee food:

043:005 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the
        man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your
        brother be with you.

043:006 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell
        the man whether ye had yet a brother?

043:007 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of
        our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another
        brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these
        words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your
        brother down?

043:008 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me,
        and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both
        we, and thou, and also our little ones.

043:009 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:
        if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then
        let me bear the blame for ever:

043:010 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this
        second time.

043:011 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now,
        do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,
        and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little
        honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:

043:012 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was
        brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in
        your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:

043:013 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:

043:014 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may
        send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved
        of my children, I am bereaved.

043:015 And the men took that present, and they took double money in
        their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt,
        and stood before Joseph.

043:016 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler
        of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready;
        for these men shall dine with me at noon.

043:017 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men
        into Joseph's house.

043:018 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into
        Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was
        returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in;
        that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and
        take us for bondmen, and our asses.

043:019 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they
        communed with him at the door of the house,

043:020 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy
        food:

043:021 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened
        our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of
        his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it
        again in our hand.

043:022 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:
        we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

043:023 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God
        of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had
        your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.

043:024 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them
        water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses
        provender.

043:025 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:
        for they heard that they should eat bread there.

043:026 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
        was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him
        to the earth.

043:027 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
        well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?

043:028 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,
        he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made
        obeisance.

043:029 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
        mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom
        ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my
        son.

043:030 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
        brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his
        chamber, and wept there.

043:031 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,
        and said, Set on bread.

043:032 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by
        themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by
        themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the
        Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

043:033 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his
        birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the
        men marvelled one at another.

043:034 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
        Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And
        they drank, and were merry with him.

044:001 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the
        men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put
        every man's money in his sack's mouth.

044:002 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the
        youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word
        that Joseph had spoken.

044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
        and their asses.

044:004 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
        Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and
        when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye
        rewarded evil for good?

044:005 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed
        he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

044:006 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

044:007 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?
        God forbid that thy servants should do according to this
        thing:

044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we
        brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then
        should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?

044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,
        and we also will be my lord's bondmen.

044:010 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he
        with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be
        blameless.

044:011 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,
        and opened every man his sack.

044:012 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the
        youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

044:013 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
        returned to the city.

044:014 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was
        yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.

044:015 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have
        done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

044:016 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we
        speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the
        iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants,
        both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.

044:017 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in
        whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as
        for you, get you up in peace unto your father.

044:018 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
        servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let
        not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as
        Pharaoh.

044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a
        brother?

044:020 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a
        child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead,
        and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

044:021 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,
        that I may set mine eyes upon him.

044:022 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for
        if he should leave his father, his father would die.

044:023 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest
        brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

044:024 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my
        father, we told him the words of my lord.

044:025 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

044:026 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be
        with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's
        face, except our youngest brother be with us.

044:027 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife
        bare me two sons:

044:028 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in
        pieces; and I saw him not since:

044:029 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye
        shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

044:030 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the
        lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the
        lad's life;

044:031 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with
        us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the
        gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

044:032 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,
        saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the
        blame to my father for ever.

044:033 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of
        the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his
        brethren.

044:034 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with
        me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my
        father.

045:001 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that
        stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.
        And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself
        known unto his brethren.

045:002 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
        heard.

045:003 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father
        yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were
        troubled at his presence.

045:004 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray
        you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your
        brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.

045:005 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that
        ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve
        life.

045:006 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet
        there are five years, in the which there shall neither be
        earing nor harvest.

045:007 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
        earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

045:008 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he
        hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house,
        and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.

045:009 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith
        thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down
        unto me, tarry not:

045:010 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be
        near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's
        children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou
        hast:

045:011 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of
        famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast,
        come to poverty.

045:012 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother
        Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

045:013 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of
        all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my
        father hither.

045:014 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and
        Benjamin wept upon his neck.

045:015 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and
        after that his brethren talked with him.

045:016 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,
        Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and
        his servants.

045:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do
        ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

045:018 And take your father and your households, and come unto me:
        and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye
        shall eat the fat of the land.

045:019 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the
        land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and
        bring your father, and come.

045:020 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of
        Egypt is your's.

045:021 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them
        wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them
        provision for the way.

045:022 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
        Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five
        changes of raiment.

045:023 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden
        with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with
        corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.

045:024 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said
        unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

045:025 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of
        Canaan unto Jacob their father,

045:026 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor
        over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he
        believed them not.

045:027 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said
        unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to
        carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:

045:028 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I
        will go and see him before I die.

046:001 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
        Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father
        Isaac.

046:002 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and
        said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

046:003 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go
        down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:

046:004 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely
        bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine
        eyes.

046:005 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel
        carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their
        wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

046:006 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had
        gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and
        all his seed with him:

046:007 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his
        sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into
        Egypt.

046:008 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
        into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

046:009 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and
        Carmi.

046:010 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and
        Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.

046:011 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

046:012 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez,
        and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the
        sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.

046:013 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and
        Shimron.

046:014 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

046:015 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in
        Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons
        and his daughters were thirty and three.

046:016 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon,
        Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.

046:017 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and
        Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber,
        and Malchiel.

046:018 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his
        daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.

046:019 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.

046:020 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and
        Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On
        bare unto him.

046:021 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,
        Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

046:022 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all
        the souls were fourteen.

046:023 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.

046:024 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and
        Shillem.

046:025 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
        daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were
        seven.

046:026 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out
        of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were
        threescore and six;

046:027 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two
        souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into
        Egypt, were threescore and ten.

046:028 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face
        unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

046:029 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel
        his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he
        fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

046:030 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen
        thy face, because thou art yet alive.

046:031 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's
        house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My
        brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of
        Canaan, are come unto me;

046:032 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed
        cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds,
        and all that they have.

046:033 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and
        shall say, What is your occupation?

046:034 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle
        from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers:
        that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is
        an abomination unto the Egyptians.

047:001 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my
        brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they
        have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they
        are in the land of Goshen.

047:002 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented
        them unto Pharaoh.

047:003 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation?
        And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both
        we, and also our fathers.

047:004 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are
        we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks;
        for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore,
        we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

047:005 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy
        brethren are come unto thee:

047:006 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make
        thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let
        them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among
        them, then make them rulers over my cattle.

047:007 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before
        Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

047:008 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?

047:009 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my
        pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have
        the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained
        unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the
        days of their pilgrimage.

047:010 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

047:011 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
        possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in
        the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

047:012 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
        father's household, with bread, according to their families.

047:013 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was
        very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of
        Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.

047:014 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the
        land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which
        they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's
        house.

047:015 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of
        Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us
        bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money
        faileth.

047:016 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for
        your cattle, if money fail.

047:017 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave
        them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for
        the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them
        with bread for all their cattle for that year.

047:018 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,
        and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that
        our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle;
        there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our
        bodies, and our lands:

047:019 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our
        land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will
        be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live,
        and not die, that the land be not desolate.

047:020 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
        Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine
        prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.

047:021 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end
        of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

047:022 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests
        had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their
        portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their
        lands.

047:023 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you
        this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you,
        and ye shall sow the land.

047:024 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give
        the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own,
        for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your
        households, and for food for your little ones.

047:025 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in
        the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

047:026 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,
        that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of
        the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.

047:027 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of
        Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and
        multiplied exceedingly.

047:028 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the
        whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

047:029 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his
        son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in
        thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal
        kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:

047:030 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
        Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will
        do as thou hast said.

047:031 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel
        bowed himself upon the bed's head.

048:001 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,
        Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,
        Manasseh and Ephraim.

048:002 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh
        unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the
        bed.

048:003 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at
        Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

048:004 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and
        multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people;
        and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an
        everlasting possession.

048:005 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born
        unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into
        Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

048:006 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be
        thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in
        their inheritance.

048:007 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in
        the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little
        way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of
        Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.

048:008 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

048:009 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God
        hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray
        thee, unto me, and I will bless them.

048:010 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not
        see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them,
        and embraced them.

048:011 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy
        face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

048:012 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he
        bowed himself with his face to the earth.

048:013 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward
        Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward
        Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.

048:014 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon
        Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon
        Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was
        the firstborn.

048:015 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers
        Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life
        long unto this day,

048:016 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and
        let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers
        Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the
        midst of the earth.

048:017 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon
        the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his
        father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto
        Manasseh's head.

048:018 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this
        is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

048:019 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know
        it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great:
        but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and
        his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

048:020 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel
        bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and
        he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

048:021 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be
        with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

048:022 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,
        which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and
        with my bow.

049:001 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves
        together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in
        the last days.

049:002 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and
        hearken unto Israel your father.

049:003 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of
        my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of
        power:

049:004 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest
        up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to
        my couch.

049:005 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in
        their habitations.

049:006 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their
        assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger
        they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a
        wall.

049:007 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for
        it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in
        Israel.

049:008 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand
        shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children
        shall bow down before thee.

049:009 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone
        up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion;
        who shall rouse him up?

049:010 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from
        between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the
        gathering of the people be.

049:011 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the
        choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes
        in the blood of grapes:

049:012 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with
        milk.

049:013 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be
        for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.

049:014 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

049:015 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was
        pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant
        unto tribute.

049:016 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

049:017 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that
        biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

049:018 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

049:019 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the
        last.

049:020 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
        dainties.

049:021 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

049:022 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;
        whose branches run over the wall:

049:023 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and
        hated him:

049:024 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were
        made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from
        thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

049:025 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the
        Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,
        blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the
        breasts, and of the womb:

049:026 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings
        of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting
        hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown
        of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

049:027 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour
        the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

049:028 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that
        their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one
        according to his blessing he blessed them.

049:029 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered
        unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in
        the field of Ephron the Hittite,

049:030 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before
        Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the
        field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a
        buryingplace.

049:031 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they
        buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

049:032 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was
        from the children of Heth.

049:033 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he
        gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost,
        and was gathered unto his people.

050:001 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and
        kissed him.

050:002 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
        father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

050:003 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled
        the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians
        mourned for him threescore and ten days.

050:004 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto
        the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in
        your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

050:005 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which
        I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou
        bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my
        father, and I will come again.

050:006 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he
        made thee swear.

050:007 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up
        all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all
        the elders of the land of Egypt,

050:008 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his
        father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and
        their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.

050:009 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it
        was a very great company.

050:010 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
        Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore
        lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.

050:011 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
        mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous
        mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called
        Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.

050:012 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:

050:013 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried
        him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham
        bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of
        Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

050:014 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all
        that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried
        his father.

050:015 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,
        they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will
        certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.

050:016 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
        command before he died, saying,

050:017 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the
        trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto
        thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the
        servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they
        spake unto him.

050:018 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and
        they said, Behold, we be thy servants.

050:019 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of
        God?

050:020 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it
        unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much
        people alive.

050:021 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little
        ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

050:022 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and
        Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.

050:023 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the
        children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up
        upon Joseph's knees.

050:024 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely
        visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which
        he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

050:025 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God
        will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from
        hence.

050:026 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
        embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

Book 02	Exodus

001:001 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
        into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

001:002 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

001:003 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

001:004 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

001:005 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were
        seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

001:006 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that
        generation.

001:007 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased
        abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and
        the land was filled with them.

001:008 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not
        Joseph.

001:009 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the
        children of Israel are more and mightier than we:

001:010 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and
        it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they
        join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get
        them up out of the land.

001:011 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them
        with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure
        cities, Pithom and Raamses.

001:012 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and
        grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

001:013 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with
        rigour:

001:014 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter,
        and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all
        their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

001:015 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which
        the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other
        Puah:

001:016 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew
        women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye
        shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

001:017 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
        commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

001:018 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto
        them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men
        children alive?

001:019 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women
        are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are
        delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.

001:020 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
        multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

001:021 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he
        made them houses.

001:022 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is
        born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall
        save alive.

002:001 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
        daughter of Levi.

002:002 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him
        that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

002:003 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an
        ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and
        put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the
        river's brink.

002:004 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to
        him.

002:005 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
        river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and
        when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to
        fetch it.

002:006 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold,
        the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This
        is one of the Hebrews' children.

002:007 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and
        call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse
        the child for thee?

002:008 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and
        called the child's mother.

002:009 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away,
        and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the
        women took the child, and nursed it.

002:010 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's
        daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name
        Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.

002:011 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that
        he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens:
        and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his
        brethren.

002:012 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that
        there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the
        sand.

002:013 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
        Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the
        wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?

002:014 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?
        intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And
        Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.

002:015 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses.
        But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land
        of Midian: and he sat down by a well.

002:016 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came
        and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's
        flock.

002:017 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up
        and helped them, and watered their flock.

002:018 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it
        that ye are come so soon to day?

002:019 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
        shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the
        flock.

002:020 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it
        that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

002:021 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
        Zipporah his daughter.

002:022 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he
        said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

002:023 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt
        died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the
        bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by
        reason of the bondage.

002:024 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
        with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

002:025 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had
        respect unto them.

003:001 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the
        priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the
        desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

003:002 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire
        out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the
        bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

003:003 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great
        sight, why the bush is not burnt.

003:004 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called
        unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses.
        And he said, Here am I.

003:005 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off
        thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

003:006 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of
        Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid
        his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.

003:007 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my
        people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason
        of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;

003:008 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the
        Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good
        land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey;
        unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
        Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
        Jebusites.

003:009 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is
        come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith
        the Egyptians oppress them.

003:010 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that
        thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out
        of Egypt.

003:011 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto
        Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel
        out of Egypt?

003:012 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be
        a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast
        brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon
        this mountain.

003:013 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children
        of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers
        hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his
        name? what shall I say unto them?

003:014 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
        shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me
        unto you.

003:015 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
        children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of
        Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me
        unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial
        unto all generations.

003:016 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto
        them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of
        Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely
        visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:

003:017 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of
        Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and
        the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
        Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

003:018 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou
        and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall
        say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us:
        and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into
        the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.

003:019 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no,
        not by a mighty hand.

003:020 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my
        wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that
        he will let you go.

003:021 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the
        Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye
        shall not go empty.

003:022 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
        sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
        and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon
        your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

004:001 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not
        believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The
        LORD hath not appeared unto thee.

004:002 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he
        said, A rod.

004:003 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the
        ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before
        it.

004:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take
        it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and
        it became a rod in his hand:

004:005 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the
        God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath
        appeared unto thee.

004:006 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand
        into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when
        he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

004:007 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put
        his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his
        bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

004:008 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee,
        neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will
        believe the voice of the latter sign.

004:009 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these
        two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt
        take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land:
        and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become
        blood upon the dry land.

004:010 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,
        neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy
        servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

004:011 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who
        maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have
        not I the LORD?

004:012 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee
        what thou shalt say.

004:013 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
        whom thou wilt send.

004:014 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he
        said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can
        speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee:
        and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.

004:015 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and
        I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach
        you what ye shall do.

004:016 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall
        be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou
        shalt be to him instead of God.

004:017 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou
        shalt do signs.

004:018 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and
        said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my
        brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet
        alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

004:019 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:
        for all the men are dead which sought thy life.

004:020 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an
        ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the
        rod of God in his hand.

004:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into
        Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh,
        which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart,
        that he shall not let the people go.

004:022 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel
        is my son, even my firstborn:

004:023 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and
        if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,
        even thy firstborn.

004:024 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met
        him, and sought to kill him.

004:025 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of
        her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody
        husband art thou to me.

004:026 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,
        because of the circumcision.

004:027 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet
        Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and
        kissed him.

004:028 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent
        him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.

004:029 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders
        of the children of Israel:

004:030 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto
        Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

004:031 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had
        visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon
        their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

005:001 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus
        saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may
        hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.

005:002 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his
        voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I
        let Israel go.

005:003 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us
        go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and
        sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with
        pestilence, or with the sword.

005:004 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses
        and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your
        burdens.

005:005 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many,
        and ye make them rest from their burdens.

005:006 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the
        people, and their officers, saying,

005:007 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as
        heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.

005:008 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye
        shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for
        they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and
        sacrifice to our God.

005:009 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
        therein; and let them not regard vain words.

005:010 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their
        officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith
        Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

005:011 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of
        your work shall be diminished.

005:012 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of
        Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

005:013 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works,
        your daily tasks, as when there was straw.

005:014 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
        taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded,
        Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both
        yesterday and to day, as heretofore?

005:015 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried
        unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy
        servants?

005:016 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us,
        Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the
        fault is in thine own people.

005:017 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let
        us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.

005:018 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given
        you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

005:019 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they
        were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish
        ought from your bricks of your daily task.

005:020 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they
        came forth from Pharaoh:

005:021 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge;
        because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of
        Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in
        their hand to slay us.

005:022 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore
        hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou
        hast sent me?

005:023 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done
        evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at
        all.

006:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will
        do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go,
        and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

006:002 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:

006:003 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by
        the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not
        known to them.

006:004 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give
        them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein
        they were strangers.

006:005 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel,
        whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my
        covenant.

006:006 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and
        I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,
        and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you
        with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:

006:007 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a
        God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which
        bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

006:008 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I
        did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I
        will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.

006:009 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they
        hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel
        bondage.

006:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:011 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the
        children of Israel go out of his land.

006:012 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children
        of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh
        hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?

006:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a
        charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of
        Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of
        Egypt.

006:014 These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of
        Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and
        Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.

006:015 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and
        Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman:
        these are the families of Simeon.

006:016 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
        generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of
        the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

006:017 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their
        families.

006:018 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and
        Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred
        thirty and three years.

006:019 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the
        families of Levi according to their generations.

006:020 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and
        she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of
        Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.

006:021 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

006:022 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

006:023 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of
        Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar,
        and Ithamar.

006:024 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these
        are the families of the Korhites.

006:025 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of
        Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads
        of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.

006:026 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring
        out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to
        their armies.

006:027 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring
        out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses
        and Aaron.

006:028 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses
        in the land of Egypt,

006:029 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak
        thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

006:030 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised
        lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

007:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to
        Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

007:002 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy
        brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of
        Israel out of his land.

007:003 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and
        my wonders in the land of Egypt.

007:004 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand
        upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the
        children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great
        judgments.

007:005 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I
        stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children
        of Israel from among them.

007:006 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did
        they.

007:007 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and
        three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

007:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

007:009 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for
        you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it
        before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

007:010 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as
        the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before
        Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

007:011 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now
        the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with
        their enchantments.

007:012 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became
        serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

007:013 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto
        them; as the LORD had said.

007:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he
        refuseth to let the people go.

007:015 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto
        the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against
        he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou
        take in thine hand.

007:016 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath
        sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may
        serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou
        wouldest not hear.

007:017 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the
        LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand
        upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be
        turned to blood.

007:018 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river
        shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the
        water of the river.

007:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod,
        and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon
        their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and
        upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and
        that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both
        in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.

007:020 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he
        lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the
        river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his
        servants; and all the waters that were in the river were
        turned to blood.

007:021 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank,
        and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river;
        and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

007:022 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
        Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto
        them; as the LORD had said.

007:023 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set
        his heart to this also.

007:024 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water
        to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

007:025 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten
        the river.

008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto
        him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may
        serve me.

008:002 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all
        thy borders with frogs:

008:003 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall
        go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and
        upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy
        people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:

008:004 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people,
        and upon all thy servants.

008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth
        thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and
        over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of
        Egypt.

008:006 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and
        the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

008:007 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought
        up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

008:008 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the
        LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my
        people; and I will let the people go, that they may do
        sacrifice unto the LORD.

008:009 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I
        intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to
        destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may
        remain in the river only?

008:010 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy
        word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the
        LORD our God.

008:011 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and
        from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in
        the river only.

008:012 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried
        unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought
        against Pharaoh.

008:013 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs
        died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the
        fields.

008:014 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land
        stank.

008:015 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his
        heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

008:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy
        rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice
        throughout all the land of Egypt.

008:017 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his
        rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in
        man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice
        throughout all the land of Egypt.

008:018 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring
        forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man,
        and upon beast.

008:019 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of
        God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not
        unto them; as the LORD had said.

008:020 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
        and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water;
        and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that
        they may serve me.

008:021 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send
        swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy
        people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians
        shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon
        they are.

008:022 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my
        people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the
        end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the
        earth.

008:023 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to
        morrow shall this sign be.

008:024 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies
        into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and
        into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason
        of the swarm of flies.

008:025 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
        sacrifice to your God in the land.

008:026 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall
        sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our
        God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians
        before their eyes, and will they not stone us?

008:027 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and
        sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.

008:028 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to
        the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very
        far away: intreat for me.

008:029 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat
        the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh,
        from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not
        Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go
        to sacrifice to the LORD.

008:030 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

008:031 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he
        removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants,
        and from his people; there remained not one.

008:032 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither
        would he let the people go.

009:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell
        him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go,
        that they may serve me.

009:002 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,

009:003 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in
        the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels,
        upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very
        grievous murrain.

009:004 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the
        cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is
        the children's of Israel.

009:005 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD
        shall do this thing in the land.

009:006 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle
        of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel
        died not one.

009:007 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle
        of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
        and he did not let the people go.

009:008 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you
        handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it
        toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

009:009 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and
        shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon
        beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

009:010 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh;
        and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil
        breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.

009:011 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the
        boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the
        Egyptians.

009:012 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened
        not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.

009:013 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
        and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the
        LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve
        me.

009:014 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart,
        and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest
        know that there is none like me in all the earth.

009:015 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and
        thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the
        earth.

009:016 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to
        shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared
        throughout all the earth.

009:017 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt
        not let them go?

009:018 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a
        very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the
        foundation thereof even until now.

009:019 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou
        hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be
        found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail
        shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

009:020 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of
        Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:

009:021 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his
        servants and his cattle in the field.

009:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
        heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon
        man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field,
        throughout the land of Egypt.

009:023 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD
        sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground;
        and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

009:024 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very
        grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of
        Egypt since it became a nation.

009:025 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that
        was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every
        herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.

009:026 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,
        was there no hail.

009:027 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said
        unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and
        I and my people are wicked.

009:028 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more
        mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye
        shall stay no longer.

009:029 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city,
        I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder
        shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou
        mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.

009:030 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet
        fear the LORD God.

009:031 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in
        the ear, and the flax was bolled.

009:032 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not
        grown up.

009:033 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad
        his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and
        the rain was not poured upon the earth.

009:034 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the
        thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his
        heart, he and his servants.

009:035 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let
        the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

010:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have
        hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I
        might shew these my signs before him:

010:002 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy
        son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs
        which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am
        the LORD.

010:003 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him,
        Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou
        refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that
        they may serve me.

010:004 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow
        will I bring the locusts into thy coast:

010:005 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be
        able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that
        which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and
        shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:

010:006 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy
        servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither
        thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day
        that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned
        himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

010:007 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man
        be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the
        LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

010:008 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he
        said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they
        that shall go?

010:009 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old,
        with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with
        our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.

010:010 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will
        let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is
        before you.

010:011 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that
        ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's
        presence.

010:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
        land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the
        land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that
        the hail hath left.

010:013 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and
        the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and
        all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought
        the locusts.

010:014 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested
        in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before
        them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them
        shall be such.

010:015 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land
        was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all
        the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there
        remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of
        the field, through all the land of Egypt.

010:016 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said,
        I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.

010:017 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
        intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this
        death only.

010:018 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

010:019 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away
        the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained
        not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.

010:020 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not
        let the children of Israel go.

010:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward
        heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt,
        even darkness which may be felt.

010:022 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there
        was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

010:023 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for
        three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their
        dwellings.

010:024 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the
        LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your
        little ones also go with you.

010:025 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
        offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.

010:026 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be
        left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our
        God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until
        we come thither.

010:027 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let
        them go.

010:028 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to
        thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my
        face thou shalt die.

010:029 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face
        again no more.

011:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more
        upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go
        hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you
        out hence altogether.

011:002 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow
        of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of
        silver and jewels of gold.

011:003 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
        Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land
        of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight
        of the people.

011:004 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go
        out into the midst of Egypt:

011:005 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the
        first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto
        the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and
        all the firstborn of beasts.

011:006 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of
        Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it
        any more.

011:007 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move
        his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that
        the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and
        Israel.

011:008 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow
        down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the
        people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he
        went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.

011:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto
        you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

011:010 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and
        the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let
        the children of Israel go out of his land.

012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
        saying,

012:002 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall
        be the first month of the year to you.

012:003 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the
        tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a
        lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an
        house:

012:004 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and
        his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the
        number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall
        make your count for the lamb.

012:005 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year:
        ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

012:006 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same
        month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel
        shall kill it in the evening.

012:007 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two
        side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein
        they shall eat it.

012:008 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire,
        and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

012:009 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast
        with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance
        thereof.

012:010 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and
        that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn
        with fire.

012:011 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes
        on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it
        in haste: it is the LORD's passover.

012:012 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will
        smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and
        beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute
        judgment: I am the LORD.

012:013 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses
        where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you,
        and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I
        smite the land of Egypt.

012:014 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall
        keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye
        shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.

012:015 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day
        ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever
        eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh
        day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

012:016 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and
        in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you;
        no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every
        man must eat, that only may be done of you.

012:017 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in
        this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land
        of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your
        generations by an ordinance for ever.

012:018 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at
        even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and
        twentieth day of the month at even.

012:019 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for
        whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall
        be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a
        stranger, or born in the land.

012:020 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall
        ye eat unleavened bread.

012:021 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto
        them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families,
        and kill the passover.

012:022 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood
        that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side
        posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you
        shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.

012:023 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and
        when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side
        posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer
        the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.

012:024 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and
        to thy sons for ever.

012:025 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which
        the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye
        shall keep this service.

012:026 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto
        you, What mean ye by this service?

012:027 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover,
        who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt,
        when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the
        people bowed the head and worshipped.

012:028 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had
        commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

012:029 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the
        firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
        that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that
        was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

012:030 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants,
        and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for
        there was not a house where there was not one dead.

012:031 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
        and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the
        children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.

012:032 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be
        gone; and bless me also.

012:033 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might
        send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all
        dead men.

012:034 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
        kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their
        shoulders.

012:035 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
        and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and
        jewels of gold, and raiment:

012:036 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
        Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they
        required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.

012:037 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
        about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside
        children.

012:038 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and
        herds, even very much cattle.

012:039 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they
        brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because
        they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither
        had they prepared for themselves any victual.

012:040 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in
        Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

012:041 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty
        years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the
        hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

012:042 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing
        them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the
        LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their
        generations.

012:043 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance
        of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:

012:044 But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou
        hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

012:045 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

012:046 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth
        ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye
        break a bone thereof.

012:047 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

012:048 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
        passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and
        then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one
        that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall
        eat thereof.

012:049 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the
        stranger that sojourneth among you.

012:050 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded
        Moses and Aaron, so did they.

012:051 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring
        the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their
        armies.

013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

013:002 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the
        womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast:
        it is mine.

013:003 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye
        came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by
        strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place:
        there shall no leavened bread be eaten.

013:004 This day came ye out in the month Abib.

013:005 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land
        of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
        Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to
        give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt
        keep this service in this month.

013:006 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh
        day shall be a feast to the LORD.

013:007 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no
        leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be
        leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.

013:008 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done
        because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth
        out of Egypt.

013:009 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for
        a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in
        thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee
        out of Egypt.

013:010 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from
        year to year.

013:011 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land
        of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers,
        and shall give it thee,

013:012 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the
        matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou
        hast; the males shall be the LORD's.

013:013 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb;
        and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his
        neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt
        thou redeem.

013:014 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
        saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By
        strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the
        house of bondage:

013:015 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that
        the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the
        firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I
        sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being
        males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.

013:016 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
        between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought
        us forth out of Egypt.

013:017 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that
        God led them not through the way of the land of the
        Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest
        peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they
        return to Egypt:

013:018 But God led the people about, through the way of the
        wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up
        harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

013:019 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had
        straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely
        visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

013:020 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in
        Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.

013:021 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud,
        to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to
        give them light; to go by day and night:

013:022 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the
        pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

014:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp
        before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against
        Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.

014:003 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are
        entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

014:004 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after
        them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his
        host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they
        did so.

014:005 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and
        the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against
        the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have
        let Israel go from serving us?

014:006 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:

014:007 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots
        of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

014:008 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
        he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of
        Israel went out with an high hand.

014:009 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and
        chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and
        overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before
        Baalzephon.

014:010 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up
        their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and
        they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out
        unto the LORD.

014:011 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in
        Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness?
        wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out
        of Egypt?

014:012 Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying,
        Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been
        better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die
        in the wilderness.

014:013 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and
        see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to
        day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see
        them again no more for ever.

014:014 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

014:015 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
        speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:

014:016 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the
        sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry
        ground through the midst of the sea.

014:017 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and
        they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh,
        and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his
        horsemen.

014:018 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have
        gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his
        horsemen.

014:019 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,
        removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went
        from before their face, and stood behind them:

014:020 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of
        Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave
        light by night to these: so that the one came not near the
        other all the night.

014:021 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD
        caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that
        night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

014:022 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon
        the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their
        right hand, and on their left.

014:023 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst
        of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his
        horsemen.

014:024 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked
        unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and
        of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,

014:025 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them
        heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face
        of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the
        Egyptians.

014:026 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
        sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon
        their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

014:027 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
        returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the
        Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the
        Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

014:028 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
        horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea
        after them; there remained not so much as one of them.

014:029 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst
        of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their
        right hand, and on their left.

014:030 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
        Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea
        shore.

014:031 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the
        Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the
        LORD, and his servant Moses.

015:001 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
        LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he
        hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he
        thrown into the sea.

015:002 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my
        salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation;
        my father's God, and I will exalt him.

015:003 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.

015:004 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his
        chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

015:005 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a
        stone.

015:006 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right
        hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

015:007 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
        them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath,
        which consumed them as stubble.

015:008 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
        together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths
        were congealed in the heart of the sea.

015:009 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide
        the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw
        my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

015:010 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank
        as lead in the mighty waters.

015:011 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like
        thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

015:012 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

015:013 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
        redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
        habitation.

015:014 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold
        on the inhabitants of Palestina.

015:015 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of
        Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants
        of Canaan shall melt away.

015:016 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine
        arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass
        over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast
        purchased.

015:017 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
        thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made
        for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy
        hands have established.

015:018 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

015:019 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with
        his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the
        waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went
        on dry land in the midst of the sea.

015:020 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel
        in her hand; and all the women went out after her with
        timbrels and with dances.

015:021 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath
        triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown
        into the sea.

015:022 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out
        into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the
        wilderness, and found no water.

015:023 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the
        waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of
        it was called Marah.

015:024 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we
        drink?

015:025 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree,
        which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made
        sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and
        there he proved them,

015:026 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the
        LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight,
        and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his
        statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I
        have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that
        healeth thee.

015:027 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
        threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the
        waters.

016:001 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the
        congregation of the children of Israel came unto the
        wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the
        fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of
        the land of Egypt.

016:002 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
        against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

016:003 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had
        died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat
        by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for
        ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this
        whole assembly with hunger.

016:004 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
        heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a
        certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they
        will walk in my law, or no.

016:005 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall
        prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as
        much as they gather daily.

016:006 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
        even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out
        from the land of Egypt:

016:007 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD;
        for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what
        are we, that ye murmur against us?

016:008 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in
        the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the
        full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye
        murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not
        against us, but against the LORD.

016:009 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of
        the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath
        heard your murmurings.

016:010 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole
        congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked
        toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD
        appeared in the cloud.

016:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

016:012 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak
        unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the
        morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that
        I am the LORD your God.

016:013 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
        covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about
        the host.

016:014 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face
        of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as
        the hoar frost on the ground.

016:015 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to
        another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses
        said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given
        you to eat.

016:016 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it
        every man according to his eating, an omer for every man,
        according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for
        them which are in his tents.

016:017 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more,
        some less.

016:018 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much
        had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack;
        they gathered every man according to his eating.

016:019 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

016:020 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of
        them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and
        stank: and Moses was wroth with them.

016:021 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
        eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

016:022 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice
        as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of
        the congregation came and told Moses.

016:023 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said,
        To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake
        that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will
        seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be
        kept until the morning.

016:024 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it
        did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.

016:025 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
        the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

016:026 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is
        the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

016:027 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on
        the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

016:028 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
        commandments and my laws?

016:029 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore
        he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye
        every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the
        seventh day.

016:030 So the people rested on the seventh day.

016:031 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it
        was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like
        wafers made with honey.

016:032 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,
        Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they
        may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness,
        when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

016:033 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
        manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for
        your generations.

016:034 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
        Testimony, to be kept.

016:035 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until
        they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they
        came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.

016:036 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

017:001 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed
        from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to
        the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and
        there was no water for the people to drink.

017:002 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
        water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide
        ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?

017:003 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people
        murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou
        hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children
        and our cattle with thirst?

017:004 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto
        this people? they be almost ready to stone me.

017:005 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and
        take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith
        thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.

017:006 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
        and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out
        of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the
        sight of the elders of Israel.

017:007 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah,
        because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because
        they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?

017:008 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

017:009 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out,
        fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the
        hill with the rod of God in mine hand.

017:010 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with
        Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the
        hill.

017:011 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
        prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

017:012 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
        under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his
        hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other
        side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the
        sun.

017:013 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
        the sword.

017:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a
        book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will
        utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

017:015 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it
        Jehovahnissi:

017:016 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will
        have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

018:001 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard
        of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people,
        and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;

018:002 Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife,
        after he had sent her back,

018:003 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom;
        for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

018:004 And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my
        father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the
        sword of Pharaoh:

018:005 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his
        wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the
        mount of God:

018:006 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come
        unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

018:007 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did
        obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their
        welfare; and they came into the tent.

018:008 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done
        unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all
        the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the
        LORD delivered them.

018:009 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had
        done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the
        Egyptians.

018:010 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you
        out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of
        Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of
        the Egyptians.

018:011 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the
        thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

018:012 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and
        sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of
        Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.

018:013 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
        people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto
        the evening.

018:014 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the
        people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the
        people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people
        stand by thee from morning unto even?

018:015 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come
        unto me to enquire of God:

018:016 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge
        between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes
        of God, and his laws.

018:017 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
        doest is not good.

018:018 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is
        with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not
        able to perform it thyself alone.

018:019 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God
        shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that
        thou mayest bring the causes unto God:

018:020 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew
        them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they
        must do.

018:021 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men,
        such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place
        such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of
        hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:

018:022 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be,
        that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every
        small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for
        thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.

018:023 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then
        thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also
        go to their place in peace.

018:024 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did
        all that he had said.

018:025 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them
        heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of
        hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

018:026 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes
        they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged
        themselves.

018:027 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way
        into his own land.

019:001 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone
        forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into
        the wilderness of Sinai.

019:002 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the
        desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there
        Israel camped before the mount.

019:003 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out
        of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of
        Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;

019:004 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you
        on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

019:005 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
        covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above
        all people: for all the earth is mine:

019:006 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy
        nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the
        children of Israel.

019:007 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and
        laid before their faces all these words which the LORD
        commanded him.

019:008 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the
        LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of
        the people unto the LORD.

019:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
        cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and
        believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people
        unto the LORD.

019:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify
        them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,

019:011 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD
        will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount
        Sinai.

019:012 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,
        Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or
        touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be
        surely put to death:

019:013 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be
        stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall
        not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up
        to the mount.

019:014 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and
        sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.

019:015 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:
        come not at your wives.

019:016 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that
        there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the
        mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that
        all the people that was in the camp trembled.

019:017 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet
        with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

019:018 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD
        descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as
        the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

019:019 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed
        louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a
        voice.

019:020 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the
        mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount;
        and Moses went up.

019:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest
        they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them
        perish.

019:022 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD,
        sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.

019:023 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to
        mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about
        the mount, and sanctify it.

019:024 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou
        shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the
        priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD,
        lest he break forth upon them.

019:025 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

020:001 And God spake all these words, saying,

020:002 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land
        of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

020:003 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

020:004 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
        likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in
        the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

020:005 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I
        the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
        the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
        generation of them that hate me;

020:006 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
        keep my commandments.

020:007 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for
        the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
        vain.

020:008 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

020:009 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

020:010 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it
        thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
        daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle,
        nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

020:011 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
        all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the
        LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

020:012 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long
        upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

020:013 Thou shalt not kill.

020:014 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

020:015 Thou shalt not steal.

020:016 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

020:017 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not
        covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his
        maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is
        thy neighbour's.

020:018 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings,
        and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and
        when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

020:019 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will
        hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

020:020 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to
        prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye
        sin not.

020:021 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the
        thick darkness where God was.

020:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the
        children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you
        from heaven.

020:023 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye
        make unto you gods of gold.

020:024 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
        thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy
        sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I
        will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

020:025 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not
        build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it,
        thou hast polluted it.

020:026 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy
        nakedness be not discovered thereon.

021:001 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

021:002 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and
        in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

021:003 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he
        were married, then his wife shall go out with him.

021:004 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him
        sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her
        master's, and he shall go out by himself.

021:005 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my
        wife, and my children; I will not go out free:

021:006 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also
        bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master
        shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him
        for ever.

021:007 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall
        not go out as the menservants do.

021:008 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to
        himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a
        strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt
        deceitfully with her.

021:009 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with
        her after the manner of daughters.

021:010 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her
        duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.

021:011 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out
        free without money.

021:012 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to
        death.

021:013 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his
        hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

021:014 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay
        him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he
        may die.

021:015 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely
        put to death.

021:016 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found
        in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

021:017 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be
        put to death.

021:018 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a
        stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:

021:019 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall
        he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of
        his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.

021:020 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and
        he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

021:021 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be
        punished: for he is his money.

021:022 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit
        depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be
        surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay
        upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.

021:023 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for
        life,

021:024 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

021:025 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

021:026 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his
        maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's
        sake.

021:027 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his
        maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's
        sake.

021:028 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox
        shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but
        the owner of the ox shall be quit.

021:029 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past,
        and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept
        him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall
        be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.

021:030 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for
        the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

021:031 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter,
        according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.

021:032 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall
        give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox
        shall be stoned.

021:033 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit,
        and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;

021:034 The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto
        the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.

021:035 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they
        shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the
        dead ox also they shall divide.

021:036 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,
        and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for
        ox; and the dead shall be his own.

022:001 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell
        it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a
        sheep.

022:002 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,
        there shall no blood be shed for him.

022:003 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for
        him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing,
        then he shall be sold for his theft.

022:004 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it
        be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.

022:005 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and
        shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field;
        of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own
        vineyard, shall he make restitution.

022:006 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of
        corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed
        therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make
        restitution.

022:007 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to
        keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be
        found, let him pay double.

022:008 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall
        be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his
        hand unto his neighbour's goods.

022:009 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for
        sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which
        another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall
        come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he
        shall pay double unto his neighbour.

022:010 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a
        sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or
        driven away, no man seeing it:

022:011 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he
        hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the
        owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it
        good.

022:012 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto
        the owner thereof.

022:013 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness,
        and he shall not make good that which was torn.

022:014 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or
        die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make
        it good.

022:015 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it
        good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.

022:016 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with
        her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

022:017 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall
        pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

022:018 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

022:019 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

022:020 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he
        shall be utterly destroyed.

022:021 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye
        were strangers in the land of Egypt.

022:022 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

022:023 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me,
        I will surely hear their cry;

022:024 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the
        sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children
        fatherless.

022:025 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,
        thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay
        upon him usury.

022:026 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou
        shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

022:027 For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin:
        wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he
        crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

022:028 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy
        people.

022:029 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits,
        and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give
        unto me.

022:030 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep:
        seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou
        shalt give it me.

022:031 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any
        flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to
        the dogs.

023:001 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with
        the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

023:002 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt
        thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:

023:003 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

023:004 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou
        shalt surely bring it back to him again.

023:005 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his
        burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely
        help with him.

023:006 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

023:007 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and
        righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

023:008 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise,
        and perverteth the words of the righteous.

023:009 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart
        of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

023:010 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the
        fruits thereof:

023:011 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still;
        that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the
        beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal
        with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.

023:012 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou
        shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son
        of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

023:013 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect:
        and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it
        be heard out of thy mouth.

023:014 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

023:015 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat
        unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time
        appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from
        Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)

023:016 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours,
        which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of
        ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast
        gathered in thy labours out of the field.

023:017 Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the
        LORD God.

023:018 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened
        bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the
        morning.

023:019 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into
        the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in
        his mother's milk.

023:020 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,
        and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

023:021 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he
        will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

023:022 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I
        speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an
        adversary unto thine adversaries.

023:023 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto
        the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the
        Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut
        them off.

023:024 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do
        after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and
        quite break down their images.

023:025 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy
        bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the
        midst of thee.

023:026 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy
        land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.

023:027 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the
        people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine
        enemies turn their backs unto thee.

023:028 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the
        Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

023:029 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest
        the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply
        against thee.

023:030 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,
        until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

023:031 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea
        of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I
        will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and
        thou shalt drive them out before thee.

023:032 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

023:033 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin
        against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a
        snare unto thee.

024:001 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and
        Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel;
        and worship ye afar off.

024:002 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not
        come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

024:003 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD,
        and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one
        voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will
        we do.

024:004 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early
        in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and
        twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

024:005 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered
        burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto
        the LORD.

024:006 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and
        half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

024:007 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience
        of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will
        we do, and be obedient.

024:008 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and
        said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath
        made with you concerning all these words.

024:009 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy
        of the elders of Israel:

024:010 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet
        as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were
        the body of heaven in his clearness.

024:011 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his
        hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.

024:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount,
        and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law,
        and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach
        them.

024:013 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up
        into the mount of God.

024:014 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we
        come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you:
        if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

024:015 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the
        mount.

024:016 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the
        cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto
        Moses out of the midst of the cloud.

024:017 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire
        on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

024:018 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up
        into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and
        forty nights.

025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an
        offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart
        ye shall take my offering.

025:003 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold,
        and silver, and brass,

025:004 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
        hair,

025:005 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
        wood,

025:006 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet
        incense,

025:007 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the
        breastplate.

025:008 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.

025:009 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the
        tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof,
        even so shall ye make it.

025:010 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a
        half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
        breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

025:011 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without
        shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold
        round about.

025:012 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in
        the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one
        side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.

025:013 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them
        with gold.

025:014 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of
        the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.

025:015 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be
        taken from it.

025:016 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall
        give thee.

025:017 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and
        a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
        breadth thereof.

025:018 And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work
        shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.

025:019 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on
        the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the
        cherubims on the two ends thereof.

025:020 And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high,
        covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces
        shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the
        faces of the cherubims be.

025:021 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in
        the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

025:022 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee
        from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims
        which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I
        will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

025:023 Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall
        be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a
        cubit and a half the height thereof.

025:024 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a
        crown of gold round about.

025:025 And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round
        about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border
        thereof round about.

025:026 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the
        rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

025:027 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the
        staves to bear the table.

025:028 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay
        them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

025:029 And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof,
        and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of
        pure gold shalt thou make them.

025:030 And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.

025:031 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work
        shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches,
        his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.

025:032 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three
        branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three
        branches of the candlestick out of the other side:

025:033 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower
        in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other
        branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that
        come out of the candlestick.

025:034 And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto
        almonds, with their knops and their flowers.

025:035 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and
        a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two
        branches of the same, according to the six branches that
        proceed out of the candlestick.

025:036 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it
        shall be one beaten work of pure gold.

025:037 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall
        light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against
        it.

025:038 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be
        of pure gold.

025:039 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these
        vessels.

025:040 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was
        shewed thee in the mount.

026:001 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of
        fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with
        cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.

026:002 The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits,
        and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of
        the curtains shall have one measure.

026:003 The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another;
        and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another.

026:004 And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one
        curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt
        thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the
        coupling of the second.

026:005 Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty
        loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in
        the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one
        of another.

026:006 And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the
        curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one
        tabernacle.

026:007 And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering
        upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.

026:008 The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the
        breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains
        shall be all of one measure.

026:009 And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six
        curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in
        the forefront of the tabernacle.

026:010 And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain
        that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge
        of the curtain which coupleth the second.

026:011 And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches
        into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be
        one.

026:012 And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent,
        the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside
        of the tabernacle.

026:013 And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of
        that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the
        tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this
        side and on that side, to cover it.

026:014 And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins
        dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.

026:015 And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood
        standing up.

026:016 Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a
        half shall be the breadth of one board.

026:017 Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one
        against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of
        the tabernacle.

026:018 And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty
        boards on the south side southward.

026:019 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty
        boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and
        two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

026:020 And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side
        there shall be twenty boards:

026:021 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
        board, and two sockets under another board.

026:022 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make
        six boards.

026:023 And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the
        tabernacle in the two sides.

026:024 And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be
        coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus
        shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.

026:025 And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver,
        sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets
        under another board.

026:026 And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards
        of the one side of the tabernacle,

026:027 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
        tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the
        tabernacle, for the two sides westward.

026:028 And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from
        end to end.

026:029 And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their
        rings of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay
        the bars with gold.

026:030 And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion
        thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.

026:031 And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet,
        and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it
        be made:

026:032 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood
        overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the
        four sockets of silver.

026:033 And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou
        mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the
        testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy
        place and the most holy.

026:034 And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the
        testimony in the most holy place.

026:035 And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the
        candlestick over against the table on the side of the
        tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on
        the north side.

026:036 And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of
        blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought
        with needlework.

026:037 And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim
        wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of
        gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.

027:001 And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits
        long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare:
        and the height thereof shall be three cubits.

027:002 And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners
        thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt
        overlay it with brass.

027:003 And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his
        shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans:
        all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass.

027:004 And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and
        upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four
        corners thereof.

027:005 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath,
        that the net may be even to the midst of the altar.

027:006 And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim
        wood, and overlay them with brass.

027:007 And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves
        shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.

027:008 Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee
        in the mount, so shall they make it.

027:009 And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south
        side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine
        twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side:

027:010 And the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall
        be of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall
        be of silver.

027:011 And likewise for the north side in length there shall be
        hangings of an hundred cubits long, and his twenty pillars and
        their twenty sockets of brass; the hooks of the pillars and
        their fillets of silver.

027:012 And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be
        hangings of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets
        ten.

027:013 And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall
        be fifty cubits.

027:014 The hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits:
        their pillars three, and their sockets three.

027:015 And on the other side shall be hangings fifteen cubits: their
        pillars three, and their sockets three.

027:016 And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty
        cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined
        linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be
        four, and their sockets four.

027:017 All the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with
        silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets of
        brass.

027:018 The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the
        breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits of fine
        twined linen, and their sockets of brass.

027:019 All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof,
        and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall
        be of brass.

027:020 And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring
        thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to
        burn always.

027:021 In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which
        is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it
        from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute
        for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children
        of Israel.

028:001 And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
        him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister
        unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu,
        Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.

028:002 And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for
        glory and for beauty.

028:003 And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I
        have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make
        Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto
        me in the priest's office.

028:004 And these are the garments which they shall make; a
        breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a
        mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for
        Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me
        in the priest's office.

028:005 And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,
        and fine linen.

028:006 And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple,
        of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.

028:007 It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two
        edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.

028:008 And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall
        be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold,
        of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

028:009 And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the
        names of the children of Israel:

028:010 Six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of
        the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.

028:011 With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of
        a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of
        the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in
        ouches of gold.

028:012 And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the
        ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and
        Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two
        shoulders for a memorial.

028:013 And thou shalt make ouches of gold;

028:014 And two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work
        shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the
        ouches.

028:015 And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning
        work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold,
        of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined
        linen, shalt thou make it.

028:016 Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the
        length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.

028:017 And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of
        stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a
        carbuncle: this shall be the first row.

028:018 And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a
        diamond.

028:019 And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

028:020 And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they
        shall be set in gold in their inclosings.

028:021 And the stones shall be with the names of the children of
        Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings
        of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according
        to the twelve tribes.

028:022 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of
        wreathen work of pure gold.

028:023 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold,
        and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the
        breastplate.

028:024 And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two
        rings which are on the ends of the breastplate.

028:025 And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt
        fasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces
        of the ephod before it.

028:026 And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them
        upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof,
        which is in the side of the ephod inward.

028:027 And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put
        them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the
        forepart thereof, over against the other coupling thereof,
        above the curious girdle of the ephod.

028:028 And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto
        the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be
        above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the
        breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.

028:029 And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in
        the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in
        unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD
        continually.

028:030 And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and
        the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he
        goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of
        the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD
        continually.

028:031 And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.

028:032 And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst
        thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the
        hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be
        not rent.

028:033 And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of
        blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem
        thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:

028:034 A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a
        pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.

028:035 And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be
        heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD,
        and when he cometh out, that he die not.

028:036 And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it,
        like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

028:037 And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the
        mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.

028:038 And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the
        iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel
        shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always
        upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.

028:039 And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou
        shalt make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the
        girdle of needlework.

028:040 And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt
        make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them,
        for glory and for beauty.

028:041 And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons
        with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and
        sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's
        office.

028:042 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their
        nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall
        reach:

028:043 And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they
        come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they
        come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that
        they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for
        ever unto him and his seed after him.

029:001 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow
        them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one
        young bullock, and two rams without blemish,

029:002 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil,
        and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour
        shalt thou make them.

029:003 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the
        basket, with the bullock and the two rams.

029:004 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with
        water.

029:005 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat,
        and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate,
        and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:

029:006 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy
        crown upon the mitre.

029:007 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his
        head, and anoint him.

029:008 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.

029:009 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and
        put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be
        theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate
        Aaron and his sons.

029:010 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the
        tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall
        put their hands upon the head of the bullock.

029:011 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door
        of the tabernacle of the congregation.

029:012 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it
        upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the
        blood beside the bottom of the altar.

029:013 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and
        the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the
        fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

029:014 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung,
        shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin
        offering.

029:015 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put
        their hands upon the head of the ram.

029:016 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood,
        and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

029:017 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of
        him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his
        head.

029:018 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a
        burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an
        offering made by fire unto the LORD.

029:019 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons
        shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

029:020 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put
        it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of
        the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right
        hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle
        the blood upon the altar round about.

029:021 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and
        of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his
        garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons
        with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his
        sons, and his sons' garments with him.

029:022 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the
        fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver,
        and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the
        right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:

029:023 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one
        wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before
        the LORD:

029:024 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands
        of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before
        the LORD.

029:025 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon
        the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the
        LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

029:026 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's
        consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD:
        and it shall be thy part.

029:027 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and
        the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which
        is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that
        which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:

029:028 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever
        from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and
        it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of
        the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave
        offering unto the LORD.

029:029 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him,
        to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

029:030 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on
        seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the
        congregation to minister in the holy place.

029:031 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe
        his flesh in the holy place.

029:032 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the
        bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of
        the congregation.

029:033 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was
        made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall
        not eat thereof, because they are holy.

029:034 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the
        bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the
        remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is
        holy.

029:035 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according
        to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt
        thou consecrate them.

029:036 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering
        for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou
        hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to
        sanctify it.

029:037 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and
        sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever
        toucheth the altar shall be holy.

029:038 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two
        lambs of the first year day by day continually.

029:039 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other
        lamb thou shalt offer at even:

029:040 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the
        fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an
        hin of wine for a drink offering.

029:041 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do
        thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and
        according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour,
        an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

029:042 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your
        generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
        before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto
        thee.

029:043 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the
        tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

029:044 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and
        the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to
        minister to me in the priest's office.

029:045 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be
        their God.

029:046 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought
        them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among
        them: I am the LORD their God.

030:001 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim
        wood shalt thou make it.

030:002 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth
        thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the
        height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.

030:003 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and
        the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou
        shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.

030:004 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of
        it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt
        thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to
        bear it withal.

030:005 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay
        them with gold.

030:006 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of
        the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the
        testimony, where I will meet with thee.

030:007 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when
        he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

030:008 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn
        incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD
        throughout your generations.

030:009 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt
        sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink
        offering thereon.

030:010 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in
        a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once
        in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your
        generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.

030:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

030:012 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their
        number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul
        unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no
        plague among them, when thou numberest them.

030:013 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that
        are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary:
        (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the
        offering of the LORD.

030:014 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from
        twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the
        LORD.

030:015 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less
        than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD,
        to make an atonement for your souls.

030:016 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of
        Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle
        of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the
        children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for
        your souls.

030:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

030:018 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of
        brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the
        tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt
        put water therein.

030:019 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
        thereat:

030:020 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they
        shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come
        near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire
        unto the LORD:

030:021 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die
        not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him
        and to his seed throughout their generations.

030:022 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

030:023 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five
        hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two
        hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred
        and fifty shekels,

030:024 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the
        sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:

030:025 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment
        compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy
        anointing oil.

030:026 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation
        therewith, and the ark of the testimony,

030:027 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his
        vessels, and the altar of incense,

030:028 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the
        laver and his foot.

030:029 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:
        whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

030:030 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,
        that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

030:031 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This
        shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your
        generations.

030:032 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make
        any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy,
        and it shall be holy unto you.

030:033 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of
        it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

030:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,
        stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure
        frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:

030:035 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art
        of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:

030:036 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it
        before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation,
        where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

030:037 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not
        make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it
        shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.

030:038 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall
        even be cut off from his people.

031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

031:002 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of
        Hur, of the tribe of Judah:

031:003 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and
        in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
        workmanship,

031:004 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and
        in brass,

031:005 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
        timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

031:006 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of
        Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that
        are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all
        that I have commanded thee;

031:007 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the
        testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the
        furniture of the tabernacle,

031:008 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with
        all his furniture, and the altar of incense,

031:009 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and
        the laver and his foot,

031:010 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the
        priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the
        priest's office,

031:011 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place:
        according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

031:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

031:013 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my
        sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you
        throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the
        LORD that doth sanctify you.

031:014 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:
        every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for
        whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off
        from among his people.

031:015 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath
        of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the
        sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

031:016 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to
        observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a
        perpetual covenant.

031:017 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever:
        for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the
        seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

031:018 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing
        with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of
        stone, written with the finger of God.

032:001 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of
        the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron,
        and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us;
        for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
        land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

032:002 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which
        are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your
        daughters, and bring them unto me.

032:003 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in
        their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

032:004 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a
        graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they
        said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out
        of the land of Egypt.

032:005 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron
        made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.

032:006 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt
        offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat
        down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.

032:007 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy
        people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have
        corrupted themselves:

032:008 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I
        commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have
        worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These
        be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the
        land of Egypt.

032:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,
        behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

032:010 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against
        them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a
        great nation.

032:011 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth
        thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought
        forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a
        mighty hand?

032:012 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief
        did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to
        consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce
        wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.

032:013 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom
        thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will
        multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land
        that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they
        shall inherit it for ever.

032:014 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto
        his people.

032:015 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
        tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were
        written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other
        were they written.

032:016 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the
        writing of God, graven upon the tables.

032:017 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
        he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

032:018 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for
        mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being
        overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.

032:019 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp,
        that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed
        hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them
        beneath the mount.

032:020 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the
        fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water,
        and made the children of Israel drink of it.

032:021 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee,
        that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?

032:022 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou
        knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.

032:023 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:
        for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
        land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

032:024 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break
        it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and
        there came out this calf.

032:025 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had
        made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)

032:026 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on
        the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of
        Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

032:027 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put
        every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate
        to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother,
        and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.

032:028 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses:
        and there fell of the people that day about three thousand
        men.

032:029 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,
        even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may
        bestow upon you a blessing this day.

032:030 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the
        people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto
        the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.

032:031 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people
        have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

032:032 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot
        me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.

032:033 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against
        me, him will I blot out of my book.

032:034 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I
        have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before
        thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their
        sin upon them.

032:035 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,
        which Aaron made.

033:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou
        and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of
        Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and
        to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:

033:002 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the
        Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite,
        the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

033:003 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up
        in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest
        I consume thee in the way.

033:004 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned:
        and no man did put on him his ornaments.

033:005 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of
        Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the
        midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put
        off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto
        thee.

033:006 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their
        ornaments by the mount Horeb.

033:007 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the
        camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of
        the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which
        sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the
        congregation, which was without the camp.

033:008 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
        that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent
        door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the
        tabernacle.

033:009 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the
        cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the
        tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.

033:010 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the
        tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped,
        every man in his tent door.

033:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh
        unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his
        servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out
        of the tabernacle.

033:012 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring
        up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt
        send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and
        thou hast also found grace in my sight.

033:013 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy
        sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may
        find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy
        people.

033:014 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give
        thee rest.

033:015 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us
        not up hence.

033:016 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
        found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with
        us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the
        people that are upon the face of the earth.

033:017 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that
        thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I
        know thee by name.

033:018 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

033:019 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and
        I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be
        gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on
        whom I will shew mercy.

033:020 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no
        man see me, and live.

033:021 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou
        shalt stand upon a rock:

033:022 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I
        will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with
        my hand while I pass by:

033:023 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back
        parts: but my face shall not be seen.

034:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone
        like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the
        words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.

034:002 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
        mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the
        mount.

034:003 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be
        seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor
        herds feed before that mount.

034:004 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and
        Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount
        Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the
        two tables of stone.

034:005 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
        and proclaimed the name of the LORD.

034:006 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD,
        The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and
        abundant in goodness and truth,

034:007 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
        transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the
        guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
        children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and
        to the fourth generation.

034:008 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
        worshipped.

034:009 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD,
        let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked
        people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for
        thine inheritance.

034:010 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people
        I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the
        earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou
        art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing
        that I will do with thee.

034:011 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I
        drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the
        Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

034:012 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
        inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a
        snare in the midst of thee:

034:013 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut
        down their groves:

034:014 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name
        is Jealous, is a jealous God:

034:015 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land,
        and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto
        their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;

034:016 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their
        daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go
        a whoring after their gods.

034:017 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

034:018 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou
        shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time
        of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from
        Egypt.

034:019 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among
        thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

034:020 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and
        if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All
        the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall
        appear before me empty.

034:021 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt
        rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

034:022 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits
        of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's
        end.

034:023 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before
        the LORD God, the God of Israel.

034:024 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
        borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou
        shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the
        year.

034:025 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
        neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be
        left unto the morning.

034:026 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto
        the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in
        his mother's milk.

034:027 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for
        after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with
        thee and with Israel.

034:028 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he
        did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the
        tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

034:029 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai
        with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came
        down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his
        face shone while he talked with him.

034:030 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses,
        behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to
        come nigh him.

034:031 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of
        the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with
        them.

034:032 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he
        gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him
        in mount Sinai.

034:033 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on
        his face.

034:034 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he
        took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and
        spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

034:035 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the
        skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his
        face again, until he went in to speak with him.

035:001 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of
        Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which
        the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.

035:002 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there
        shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD:
        whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.

035:003 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
        sabbath day.

035:004 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of
        Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded,
        saying,

035:005 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is
        of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD;
        gold, and silver, and brass,

035:006 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
        hair,

035:007 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
        wood,

035:008 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for
        the sweet incense,

035:009 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for
        the breastplate.

035:010 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that
        the LORD hath commanded;

035:011 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and
        his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,

035:012 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the
        vail of the covering,

035:013 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the
        shewbread,

035:014 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his
        lamps, with the oil for the light,

035:015 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,
        and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the
        entering in of the tabernacle,

035:016 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his
        staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,

035:017 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and
        the hanging for the door of the court,

035:018 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and
        their cords,

035:019 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the
        holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his
        sons, to minister in the priest's office.

035:020 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed
        from the presence of Moses.

035:021 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every
        one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's
        offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation,
        and for all his service, and for the holy garments.

035:022 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing
        hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and
        tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered
        offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.

035:023 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and
        scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of
        rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

035:024 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass
        brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was
        found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

035:025 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their
        hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and
        of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

035:026 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
        goats' hair.

035:027 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for
        the ephod, and for the breastplate;

035:028 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil,
        and for the sweet incense.

035:029 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the
        LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to
        bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to
        be made by the hand of Moses.

035:030 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath
        called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the
        tribe of Judah;

035:031 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in
        understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
        workmanship;

035:032 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver,
        and in brass,

035:033 And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
        wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

035:034 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and
        Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

035:035 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner
        of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of
        the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in
        fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work,
        and of those that devise cunning work.

036:001 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man,
        in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to
        work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary,
        according to all that the LORD had commanded.

036:002 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted
        man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one
        whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:

036:003 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the
        children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of
        the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto
        him free offerings every morning.

036:004 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the
        sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;

036:005 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more
        than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD
        commanded to make.

036:006 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be
        proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor
        woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So
        the people were restrained from bringing.

036:007 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
        it, and too much.

036:008 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of
        the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and
        blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work
        made he them.

036:009 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
        breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of
        one size.

036:010 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the
        other five curtains he coupled one unto another.

036:011 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
        selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost
        side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

036:012 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in
        the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the
        second: the loops held one curtain to another.

036:013 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one
        unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

036:014 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the
        tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

036:015 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits
        was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of
        one size.

036:016 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains
        by themselves.

036:017 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain
        in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the
        curtain which coupleth the second.

036:018 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,
        that it might be one.

036:019 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,
        and a covering of badgers' skins above that.

036:020 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood,
        standing up.

036:021 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a
        board one cubit and a half.

036:022 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another:
        thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

036:023 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the
        south side southward:

036:024 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards;
        two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two
        sockets under another board for his two tenons.

036:025 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the
        north corner, he made twenty boards,

036:026 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
        board, and two sockets under another board.

036:027 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six
        boards.

036:028 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in
        the two sides.

036:029 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the
        head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both
        the corners.

036:030 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen
        sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.

036:031 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the
        one side of the tabernacle,

036:032 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
        tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for
        the sides westward.

036:033 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from
        the one end to the other.

036:034 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of
        gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with
        gold.

036:035 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
        twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

036:036 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and
        overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast
        for them four sockets of silver.

036:037 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and
        purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;

036:038 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid
        their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five
        sockets were of brass.

037:001 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a
        half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth
        of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:

037:002 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made
        a crown of gold to it round about.

037:003 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four
        corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two
        rings upon the other side of it.

037:004 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
        gold.

037:005 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark,
        to bear the ark.

037:006 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half
        was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth
        thereof.

037:007 And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece
        made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;

037:008 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the
        other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the
        cherubims on the two ends thereof.

037:009 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered
        with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to
        another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the
        cherubims.

037:010 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the
        length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit
        and a half the height thereof:

037:011 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown
        of gold round about.

037:012 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;
        and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

037:013 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon
        the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

037:014 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the
        staves to bear the table.

037:015 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
        gold, to bear the table.

037:016 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes,
        and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal,
        of pure gold.

037:017 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made
        he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his
        knops, and his flowers, were of the same:

037:018 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three
        branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and
        three branches of the candlestick out of the other side
        thereof:

037:019 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a
        knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in
        another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six
        branches going out of the candlestick.

037:020 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his
        knops, and his flowers:

037:021 And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under
        two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the
        same, according to the six branches going out of it.

037:022 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was
        one beaten work of pure gold.

037:023 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his
        snuffdishes, of pure gold.

037:024 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels
        thereof.

037:025 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of
        it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was
        foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns
        thereof were of the same.

037:026 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the
        sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made
        unto it a crown of gold round about.

037:027 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof,
        by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be
        places for the staves to bear it withal.

037:028 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
        gold.

037:029 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of
        sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

038:001 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five
        cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth
        thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height
        thereof.

038:002 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the
        horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.

038:003 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the
        shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans:
        all the vessels thereof made he of brass.

038:004 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the
        compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.

038:005 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of
        brass, to be places for the staves.

038:006 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
        brass.

038:007 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the
        altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with
        boards.

038:008 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass,
        of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled
        at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

038:009 And he made the court: on the south side southward the
        hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred
        cubits:

038:010 Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty;
        the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

038:011 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits,
        their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty;
        the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.

038:012 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their
        pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars
        and their fillets of silver.

038:013 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.

038:014 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits;
        their pillars three, and their sockets three.

038:015 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and
        that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars
        three, and their sockets three.

038:016 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined
        linen.

038:017 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of
        the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of
        their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court
        were filleted with silver.

038:018 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of
        blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and
        twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth
        was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.

038:019 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four;
        their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters
        and their fillets of silver.

038:020 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round
        about, were of brass.

038:021 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of
        testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of
        Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar,
        son to Aaron the priest.

038:022 And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of
        Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.

038:023 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of
        Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in
        blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

038:024 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of
        the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and
        nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the
        shekel of the sanctuary.

038:025 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation
        was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and
        threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the
        sanctuary:

038:026 A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the
        shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be
        numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred
        thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.

038:027 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of
        the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets
        of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

038:028 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he
        made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and
        filleted them.

038:029 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two
        thousand and four hundred shekels.

038:030 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the
        brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,

038:031 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of
        the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all
        the pins of the court round about.

039:001 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of
        service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy
        garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.

039:002 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet,
        and fine twined linen.

039:003 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into
        wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the
        scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.

039:004 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the
        two edges was it coupled together.

039:005 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of
        the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and
        purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

039:006 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold,
        graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children
        of Israel.

039:007 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they
        should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as
        the LORD commanded Moses.

039:008 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of
        the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
        twined linen.

039:009 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span
        was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being
        doubled.

039:010 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a
        sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

039:011 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

039:012 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

039:013 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were
        inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

039:014 And the stones were according to the names of the children of
        Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings
        of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve
        tribes.

039:015 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of
        wreathen work of pure gold.

039:016 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put
        the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

039:017 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings
        on the ends of the breastplate.

039:018 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in
        the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the
        ephod, before it.

039:019 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends
        of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the
        side of the ephod inward.

039:020 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two
        sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over
        against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle
        of the ephod.

039:021 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings
        of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the
        curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might
        not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.

039:022 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

039:023 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of
        an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should
        not rend.

039:024 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,
        and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

039:025 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between
        the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between
        the pomegranates;

039:026 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round
        about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

039:027 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and
        for his sons,

039:028 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen,
        and linen breeches of fine twined linen,

039:029 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
        scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

039:030 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and
        wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet,
        HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

039:031 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high
        upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.

039:032 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the
        congregation finished: and the children of Israel did
        according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

039:033 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all
        his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his
        pillars, and his sockets,

039:034 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of
        badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,

039:035 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the
        mercy seat,

039:036 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,

039:037 The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the
        lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the
        oil for light,

039:038 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet
        incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,

039:039 The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all
        his vessels, the laver and his foot,

039:040 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and
        the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and
        all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent
        of the congregation,

039:041 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the
        holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to
        minister in the priest's office.

039:042 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the
        children of Israel made all the work.

039:043 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had
        done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it:
        and Moses blessed them.

040:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

040:002 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the
        tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

040:003 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover
        the ark with the vail.

040:004 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things
        that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in
        the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

040:005 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before
        the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to
        the tabernacle.

040:006 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the
        door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

040:007 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the
        congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.

040:008 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the
        hanging at the court gate.

040:009 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the
        tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and
        all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.

040:010 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all
        his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar
        most holy.

040:011 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

040:012 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

040:013 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint
        him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the
        priest's office.

040:014 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:

040:015 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father,
        that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for
        their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood
        throughout their generations.

040:016 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him,
        so did he.

040:017 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
        the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

040:018 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
        and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof,
        and reared up his pillars.

040:019 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
        covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

040:020 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
        staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:

040:021 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the
        vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as
        the LORD commanded Moses.

040:022 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the
        side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

040:023 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the
        LORD had commanded Moses.

040:024 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation,
        over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle
        southward.

040:025 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

040:026 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation
        before the vail:

040:027 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

040:028 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

040:029 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the
        tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon
        it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

040:030 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
        the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

040:031 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their
        feet thereat:

040:032 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when
        they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

040:033 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
        altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses
        finished the work.

040:034 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the
        glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

040:035 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
        congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory
        of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

040:036 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
        children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:

040:037 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not
        till the day that it was taken up.

040:038 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and
        fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of
        Israel, throughout all their journeys.

Book 03	Leviticus

001:001 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

001:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
        man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring
        your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the
        flock.

001:003 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him
        offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own
        voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation before the LORD.

001:004 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering;
        and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

001:005 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the
        priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the
        blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation.

001:006 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his
        pieces.

001:007 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the
        altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:

001:008 And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head,
        and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which
        is upon the altar:

001:009 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the
        priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice,
        an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

001:010 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or
        of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male
        without blemish.

001:011 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before
        the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his
        blood round about upon the altar.

001:012 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his
        fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that
        is on the fire which is upon the altar:

001:013 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the
        priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a
        burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
        unto the LORD.

001:014 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of
        fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of
        young pigeons.

001:015 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off
        his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof
        shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:

001:016 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast
        it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the
        ashes:

001:017 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not
        divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the
        altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt
        sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
        the LORD.

002:001 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his
        offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon
        it, and put frankincense thereon:

002:002 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he
        shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of
        the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the
        priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an
        offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:

002:003 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his
        sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD
        made by fire.

002:004 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the
        oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with
        oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

002:005 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it
        shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

002:006 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a
        meat offering.

002:007 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan,
        it shall be made of fine flour with oil.

002:008 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these
        things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the
        priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.

002:009 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
        thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering
        made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

002:010 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's
        and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the
        LORD made by fire.

002:011 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be
        made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey,
        in any offering of the LORD made by fire.

002:012 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them
        unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a
        sweet savour.

002:013 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with
        salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of
        thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine
        offerings thou shalt offer salt.

002:014 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
        LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy
        firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn
        beaten out of full ears.

002:015 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon:
        it is a meat offering.

002:016 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the
        beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the
        frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the
        LORD.

003:001 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he
        offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall
        offer it without blemish before the LORD.

003:002 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and
        kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and
        Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the
        altar round about.

003:003 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
        offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the
        inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

003:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by
        the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it
        shall he take away.

003:005 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt
        sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is
        an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

003:006 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the
        LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it
        without blemish.

003:007 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it
        before the LORD.

003:008 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and
        kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's
        sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the
        altar.

003:009 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
        offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the
        whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the
        fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon
        the inwards,

003:010 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
        by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
        it shall he take away.

003:011 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of
        the offering made by fire unto the LORD.

003:012 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before
        the LORD.

003:013 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it
        before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of
        Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round
        about.

003:014 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made
        by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and
        all the fat that is upon the inwards,

003:015 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
        by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
        it shall he take away.

003:016 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food
        of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat
        is the LORD's.

003:017 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations
        throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor
        blood.

004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

004:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin
        through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD
        concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do
        against any of them:

004:003 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of
        the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath
        sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a
        sin offering.

004:004 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle
        of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand
        upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.

004:005 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's
        blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:

004:006 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle
        of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of
        the sanctuary.

004:007 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of
        the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the
        tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood
        of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt
        offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

004:008 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for
        the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all
        the fat that is upon the inwards,

004:009 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
        by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
        it shall he take away,

004:010 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace
        offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of
        the burnt offering.

004:011 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,
        and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,

004:012 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp
        unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn
        him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out
        shall he be burnt.

004:013 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,
        and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they
        have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD
        concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;

004:014 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known,
        then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin,
        and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:015 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon
        the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall
        be killed before the LORD.

004:016 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's
        blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:

004:017 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and
        sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.

004:018 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
        which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom
        of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:019 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the
        altar.

004:020 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock
        for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest
        shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven
        them.

004:021 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and
        burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering
        for the congregation.

004:022 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance
        against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning
        things which should not be done, and is guilty;

004:023 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge;
        he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male
        without blemish:

004:024 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill
        it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the
        LORD: it is a sin offering.

004:025 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
        with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
        burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of
        the altar of burnt offering.

004:026 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of
        the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an
        atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be
        forgiven him.

004:027 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance,
        while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the
        LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be
        guilty;

004:028 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge:
        then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female
        without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.

004:029 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
        and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

004:030 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his
        finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt
        offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the
        bottom of the altar.

004:031 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is
        taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the
        priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto
        the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and
        it shall be forgiven him.

004:032 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a
        female without blemish.

004:033 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
        and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill
        the burnt offering.

004:034 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
        with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
        burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at
        the bottom of the altar:

004:035 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the
        lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
        and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to
        the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall
        make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it
        shall be forgiven him.

005:001 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a
        witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not
        utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.

005:002 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase
        of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the
        carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from
        him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.

005:003 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness
        it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from
        him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.

005:004 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or
        to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with
        an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then
        he shall be guilty in one of these.

005:005 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these
        things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that
        thing:

005:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his
        sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a
        kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall
        make an atonement for him concerning his sin.

005:007 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for
        his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two
        young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the
        other for a burnt offering.

005:008 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that
        which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head
        from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:

005:009 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon
        the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be
        wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.

005:010 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according
        to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him
        for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven
        him.

005:011 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young
        pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the
        tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he
        shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any
        frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.

005:012 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall
        take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it
        on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the
        LORD: it is a sin offering.

005:013 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his
        sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be
        forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat
        offering.

005:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

005:015 If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the
        holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass
        unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with
        thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the
        sanctuary, for a trespass offering.

005:016 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the
        holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it
        unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for
        him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be
        forgiven him.

005:017 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are
        forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though
        he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

005:018 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock,
        with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:
        and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his
        ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be
        forgiven him.

005:019 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed
        against the LORD.

006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:002 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie
        unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or
        in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath
        deceived his neighbour;

006:003 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it,
        and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth,
        sinning therein:

006:004 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that
        he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the
        thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was
        delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,

006:005 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even
        restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more
        thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the
        day of his trespass offering.

006:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram
        without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a
        trespass offering, unto the priest:

006:007 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the
        LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that
        he hath done in trespassing therein.

006:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:009 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the
        burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the
        burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the
        fire of the altar shall be burning in it.

006:010 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
        breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes
        which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the
        altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.

006:011 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments,
        and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.

006:012 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall
        not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every
        morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he
        shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.

006:013 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never
        go out.

006:014 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron
        shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.

006:015 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
        offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense
        which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the
        altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the
        LORD.

006:016 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
        unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the
        court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

006:017 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them
        for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most
        holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

006:018 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It
        shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the
        offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth
        them shall be holy.

006:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:020 This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they
        shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the
        tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering
        perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at
        night.

006:021 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou
        shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering
        shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

006:022 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall
        offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be
        wholly burnt.

006:023 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt:
        it shall not be eaten.

006:024 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:025 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of
        the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is
        killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is
        most holy.

006:026 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy
        place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

006:027 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and
        when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment,
        thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy
        place.

006:028 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken:
        and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured,
        and rinsed in water.

006:029 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most
        holy.

006:030 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into
        the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the
        holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

007:001 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most
        holy.

007:002 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they
        kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he
        sprinkle round about upon the altar.

007:003 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and
        the fat that covereth the inwards,

007:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by
        the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the
        kidneys, it shall he take away:

007:005 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering
        made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.

007:006 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be
        eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.

007:007 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is
        one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith
        shall have it.

007:008 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even
        the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt
        offering which he hath offered.

007:009 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all
        that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the
        priest's that offereth it.

007:010 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all
        the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

007:011 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
        he shall offer unto the LORD.

007:012 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with
        the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with
        oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes
        mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.

007:013 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened
        bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace
        offerings.

007:014 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an
        heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's
        that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.

007:015 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
        thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered;
        he shall not leave any of it until the morning.

007:016 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
        offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his
        sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be
        eaten:

007:017 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third
        day shall be burnt with fire.

007:018 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace
        offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be
        accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth
        it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it
        shall bear his iniquity.

007:019 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be
        eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all
        that be clean shall eat thereof.

007:020 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of
        peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his
        uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his
        people.

007:021 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
        uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable
        unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
        offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall
        be cut off from his people.

007:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

007:023 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no
        manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.

007:024 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of
        that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use:
        but ye shall in no wise eat of it.

007:025 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer
        an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that
        eateth it shall be cut off from his people.

007:026 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of
        fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.

007:027 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even
        that soul shall be cut off from his people.

007:028 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

007:029 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth
        the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring
        his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace
        offerings.

007:030 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by
        fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the
        breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.

007:031 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the
        breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

007:032 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an
        heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

007:033 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the
        peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder
        for his part.

007:034 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
        children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace
        offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto
        his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of
        Israel.

007:035 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
        anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made
        by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto
        the LORD in the priest's office;

007:036 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of
        Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for
        ever throughout their generations.

007:037 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering,
        and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of
        the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace
        offerings;

007:038 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that
        he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations
        unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.

008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

008:002 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the
        anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two
        rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;

008:003 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation.

008:004 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was
        gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

008:005 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which
        the LORD commanded to be done.

008:006 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with
        water.

008:007 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle,
        and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and
        he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound
        it unto him therewith.

008:008 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the
        breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.

008:009 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even
        upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy
        crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:010 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle
        and all that was therein, and sanctified them.

008:011 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and
        anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his
        foot, to sanctify them.

008:012 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and
        anointed him, to sanctify him.

008:013 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and
        girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the
        LORD commanded Moses.

008:014 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and
        his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the
        sin offering.

008:015 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the
        horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified
        the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar,
        and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.

008:016 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the
        caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and
        Moses burned it upon the altar.

008:017 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he
        burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:018 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and
        his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

008:019 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
        round about.

008:020 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and
        the pieces, and the fat.

008:021 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses
        burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice
        for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the
        LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:022 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and
        Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

008:023 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it
        upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his
        right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

008:024 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon
        the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right
        hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses
        sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.

008:025 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was
        upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two
        kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:

008:026 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the
        LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread,
        and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right
        shoulder:

008:027 And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands,
        and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.

008:028 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on
        the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for
        a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

008:029 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering
        before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses'
        part; as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:030 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which
        was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his
        garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with
        him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and
        his sons' garments with him.

008:031 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at
        the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat
        it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I
        commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

008:032 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall
        ye burn with fire.

008:033 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation in seven days, until the days of your
        consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate
        you.

008:034 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to
        make an atonement for you.

008:035 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of
        the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.

008:036 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded
        by the hand of Moses.

009:001 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron
        and his sons, and the elders of Israel;

009:002 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin
        offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and
        offer them before the LORD.

009:003 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take
        ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a
        lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt
        offering;

009:004 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice
        before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to
        day the LORD will appear unto you.

009:005 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the
        tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew
        near and stood before the LORD.

009:006 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded
        that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto
        you.

009:007 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy
        sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement
        for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the
        people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.

009:008 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the
        sin offering, which was for himself.

009:009 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he
        dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of
        the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the
        altar:

009:010 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of
        the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

009:011 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the
        camp.

009:012 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented
        unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the
        altar.

009:013 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the
        pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the
        altar.

009:014 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon
        the burnt offering on the altar.

009:015 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which
        was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered
        it for sin, as the first.

009:016 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to
        the manner.

009:017 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,
        and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the
        morning.

009:018 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
        offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons
        presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the
        altar round about,

009:019 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that
        which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul
        above the liver:

009:020 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat
        upon the altar:

009:021 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave
        offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.

009:022 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed
        them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the
        burnt offering, and peace offerings.

009:023 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the
        glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.

009:024 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed
        upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all
        the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

010:001 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them
        his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and
        offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them
        not.

010:002 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and
        they died before the LORD.

010:003 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,
        saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and
        before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his
        peace.

010:004 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the
        uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your
        brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

010:005 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the
        camp; as Moses had said.

010:006 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
        his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes;
        lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let
        your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning
        which the LORD hath kindled.

010:007 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD
        is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

010:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,

010:009 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with
        thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest
        ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your
        generations:

010:010 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and
        between unclean and clean;

010:011 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes
        which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.

010:012 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
        his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth
        of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without
        leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:

010:013 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due,
        and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire:
        for so I am commanded.

010:014 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
        place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for
        they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the
        sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.

010:015 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with
        the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave
        offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons'
        with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.

010:016 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
        behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and
        Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,

010:017 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy
        place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to
        bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for
        them before the LORD?

010:018 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy
        place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I
        commanded.

010:019 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered
        their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD;
        and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin
        offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of
        the LORD?

010:020 And when Moses heard that, he was content.

011:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

011:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the
        beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the
        earth.

011:003 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth
        the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

011:004 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud,
        or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he
        cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto
        you.

011:005 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not
        the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

011:006 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
        hoof; he is unclean unto you.

011:007 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,
        yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.

011:008 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye
        not touch; they are unclean to you.

011:009 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever
        hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the
        rivers, them shall ye eat.

011:010 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
        rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living
        thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination
        unto you:

011:011 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat
        of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in
        abomination.

011:012 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall
        be an abomination unto you.

011:013 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among
        the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination:
        the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

011:014 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

011:015 Every raven after his kind;

011:016 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk
        after his kind,

011:017 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

011:018 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

011:019 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and
        the bat.

011:020 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an
        abomination unto you.

011:021 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth
        upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap
        withal upon the earth;

011:022 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and
        the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind,
        and the grasshopper after his kind.

011:023 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,
        shall be an abomination unto you.

011:024 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the
        carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.

011:025 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash
        his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

011:026 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is
        not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you:
        every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.

011:027 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts
        that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso
        toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.

011:028 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his
        clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto
        you.

011:029 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things
        that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the
        tortoise after his kind,

011:030 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the
        snail, and the mole.

011:031 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth
        touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the
        even.

011:032 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth
        fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood,
        or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein
        any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be
        unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.

011:033 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,
        whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

011:034 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water
        cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in
        every such vessel shall be unclean.

011:035 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
        shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they
        shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be
        unclean unto you.

011:036 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of
        water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase
        shall be unclean.

011:037 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed
        which is to be sown, it shall be clean.

011:038 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their
        carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

011:039 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth
        the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

011:040 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his
        clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth
        the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until
        the even.

011:041 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be
        an abomination; it shall not be eaten.

011:042 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all
        four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things
        that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are
        an abomination.

011:043 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping
        thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean
        with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.

011:044 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify
        yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall
        ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that
        creepeth upon the earth.

011:045 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of
        Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am
        holy.

011:046 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every
        living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every
        creature that creepeth upon the earth:

011:047 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and
        between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not
        be eaten.

012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

012:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have
        conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be
        unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation
        for her infirmity shall she be unclean.

012:003 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
        circumcised.

012:004 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying
        three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor
        come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be
        fulfilled.

012:005 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two
        weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the
        blood of her purifying threescore and six days.

012:006 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son,
        or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year
        for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for
        a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, unto the priest:

012:007 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for
        her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood.
        This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.

012:008 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring
        two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt
        offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest
        shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.

013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,

013:002 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a
        scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like
        the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the
        priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:

013:003 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the
        flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and
        the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it
        is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and
        pronounce him unclean.

013:004 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in
        sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not
        turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the
        plague seven days:

013:005 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold,
        if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread
        not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days
        more:

013:006 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,
        behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread
        not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is
        but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

013:007 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he
        hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be
        seen of the priest again.

013:008 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the
        skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a
        leprosy.

013:009 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be
        brought unto the priest;

013:010 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be
        white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and
        there be quick raw flesh in the rising;

013:011 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest
        shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he
        is unclean.

013:012 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy
        cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head
        even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

013:013 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy
        have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that
        hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.

013:014 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

013:015 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to
        be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.

013:016 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he
        shall come unto the priest;

013:017 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be
        turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean
        that hath the plague: he is clean.

013:018 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a
        boil, and is healed,

013:019 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a
        bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to
        the priest;

013:020 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower
        than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the
        priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy
        broken out of the boil.

013:021 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
        hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be
        somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

013:022 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest
        shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.

013:023 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it
        is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

013:024 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot
        burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright
        spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

013:025 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair
        in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper
        than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning:
        wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the
        plague of leprosy.

013:026 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
        hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other
        skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up
        seven days:

013:027 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it
        be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
        pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

013:028 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in
        the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the
        burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is
        an inflammation of the burning.

013:029 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

013:030 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in
        sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin
        hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry
        scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.

013:031 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and,
        behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that
        there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up
        him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:

013:032 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague:
        and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no
        yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the
        skin;

013:033 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the
        priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:

013:034 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall:
        and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in
        sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce
        him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

013:035 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

013:036 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall
        be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow
        hair; he is unclean.

013:037 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is
        black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean:
        and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

013:038 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh
        bright spots, even white bright spots;

013:039 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots
        in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled
        spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.

013:040 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet
        is he clean.

013:041 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
        toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.

013:042 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white
        reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or
        his bald forehead.

013:043 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising
        of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald
        forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;

013:044 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce
        him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

013:045 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be
        rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his
        upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

013:046 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be
        defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp
        shall his habitation be.

013:047 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it
        be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;

013:048 Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen;
        whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

013:049 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in
        the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing
        of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto
        the priest:

013:050 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that
        hath the plague seven days:

013:051 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the
        plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
        woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the
        plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.

013:052 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in
        woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague
        is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the
        fire.

013:053 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not
        spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or
        in any thing of skin;

013:054 Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein
        the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:

013:055 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is
        washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his
        colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou
        shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be
        bare within or without.

013:056 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat
        dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the
        garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the
        woof:

013:057 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or
        in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading
        plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.

013:058 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of
        skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed
        from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall
        be clean.

013:059 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of
        woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of
        skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

014:002 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his
        cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:

014:003 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest
        shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in
        the leper;

014:004 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be
        cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and
        scarlet, and hyssop:

014:005 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed
        in an earthen vessel over running water:

014:006 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood,
        and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the
        living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the
        running water:

014:007 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the
        leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall
        let the living bird loose into the open field.

014:008 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and
        shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may
        be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and
        shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.

014:009 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all
        his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all
        his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes,
        also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

014:010 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without
        blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish,
        and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering,
        mingled with oil, and one log of oil.

014:011 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man
        that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD,
        at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:

014:012 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a
        trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a
        wave offering before the LORD:

014:013 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill
        the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place:
        for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass
        offering: it is most holy:

014:014 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
        offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the
        right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of
        his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

014:015 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it
        into the palm of his own left hand:

014:016 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is
        in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his
        finger seven times before the LORD:

014:017 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the
        priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
        cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
        great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass
        offering:

014:018 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he
        shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and
        the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.

014:019 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an
        atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness;
        and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:

014:020 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat
        offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an
        atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

014:021 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take
        one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an
        atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled
        with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;

014:022 And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able
        to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a
        burnt offering.

014:023 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing
        unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, before the LORD.

014:024 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering,
        and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave
        offering before the LORD:

014:025 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the
        priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering,
        and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
        cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
        great toe of his right foot:

014:026 And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own
        left hand:

014:027 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of
        the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD:

014:028 And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon
        the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and
        upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of
        his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass
        offering:

014:029 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall
        put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an
        atonement for him before the LORD.

014:030 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young
        pigeons, such as he can get;

014:031 Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering,
        and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering:
        and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be
        cleansed before the LORD.

014:032 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose
        hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his
        cleansing.

014:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

014:034 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you
        for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house
        of the land of your possession;

014:035 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest,
        saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the
        house:

014:036 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house,
        before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that
        is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest
        shall go in to see the house:

014:037 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be
        in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or
        reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;

014:038 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the
        house, and shut up the house seven days:

014:039 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall
        look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the
        house;

014:040 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones
        in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an
        unclean place without the city:

014:041 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about,
        and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without
        the city into an unclean place:

014:042 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of
        those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall
        plaister the house.

014:043 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house,
        after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath
        scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;

014:044 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the
        plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the
        house; it is unclean.

014:045 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the
        timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall
        carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.

014:046 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is
        shut up shall be unclean until the even.

014:047 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he
        that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

014:048 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and,
        behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the
        house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the
        house clean, because the plague is healed.

014:049 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar
        wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

014:050 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel
        over running water:

014:051 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the
        scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the
        slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house
        seven times:

014:052 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and
        with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the
        cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

014:053 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the
        open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall
        be clean.

014:054 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and
        scall,

014:055 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

014:056 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

014:057 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the
        law of leprosy.

015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,

015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any
        man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his
        issue he is unclean.

015:003 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his
        flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his
        issue, it is his uncleanness.

015:004 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean:
        and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

015:005 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and
        bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

015:006 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the
        issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
        be unclean until the even.

015:007 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue
        shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
        unclean until the even.

015:008 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean;
        then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
        and be unclean until the even.

015:009 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue
        shall be unclean.

015:010 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be
        unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those
        things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
        be unclean until the even.

015:011 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not
        rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and
        bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

015:012 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the
        issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be
        rinsed in water.

015:013 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then
        he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and
        wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and
        shall be clean.

015:014 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or
        two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the
        priest:

015:015 And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering,
        and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make
        an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.

015:016 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he
        shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the
        even.

015:017 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of
        copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until
        the even.

015:018 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of
        copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be
        unclean until the even.

015:019 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be
        blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever
        toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.

015:020 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be
        unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be
        unclean.

015:021 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and
        bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

015:022 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash
        his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until
        the even.

015:023 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth,
        when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.

015:024 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon
        him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon
        he lieth shall be unclean.

015:025 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the
        time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her
        separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall
        be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.

015:026 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be
        unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she
        sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her
        separation.

015:027 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and
        shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
        unclean until the even.

015:028 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to
        herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

015:029 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or
        two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door
        of the tabernacle of the congregation.

015:030 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
        other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an
        atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her
        uncleanness.

015:031 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
        uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they
        defile my tabernacle that is among them.

015:032 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose
        seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;

015:033 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath
        an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth
        with her that is unclean.

016:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons
        of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;

016:002 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother,
        that he come not at all times into the holy place within the
        vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die
        not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

016:003 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young
        bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

016:004 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the
        linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a
        linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired:
        these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in
        water, and so put them on.

016:005 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of
        Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram
        for a burnt offering.

016:006 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which
        is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his
        house.

016:007 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the
        LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

016:008 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the
        LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.

016:009 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell,
        and offer him for a sin offering.

016:010 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall
        be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with
        him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

016:011 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which
        is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and
        for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering
        which is for himself:

016:012 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from
        off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet
        incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:

016:013 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD,
        that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is
        upon the testimony, that he die not:

016:014 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it
        with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the
        mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger
        seven times.

016:015 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for
        the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with
        that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and
        sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:

016:016 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of
        the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of
        their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for
        the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them
        in the midst of their uncleanness.

016:017 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the
        congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy
        place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for
        himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation
        of Israel.

016:018 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD,
        and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of
        the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the
        horns of the altar round about.

016:019 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger
        seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the
        uncleanness of the children of Israel.

016:020 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place,
        and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he
        shall bring the live goat:

016:021 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live
        goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
        of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins,
        putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him
        away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:

016:022 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a
        land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the
        wilderness.

016:023 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,
        and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he
        went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:

016:024 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and
        put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt
        offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an
        atonement for himself, and for the people.

016:025 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.

016:026 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
        clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into
        the camp.

016:027 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
        offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the
        holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they
        shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their
        dung.

016:028 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his
        flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

016:029 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the
        seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict
        your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your
        own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:

016:030 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to
        cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before
        the LORD.

016:031 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict
        your souls, by a statute for ever.

016:032 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall
        consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's
        stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen
        clothes, even the holy garments:

016:033 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he
        shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an
        atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the
        congregation.

016:034 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
        atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a
        year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

017:002 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children
        of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD
        hath commanded, saying,

017:003 What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth
        an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out
        of the camp,

017:004 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the
        tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man;
        he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among
        his people:

017:005 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their
        sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they
        may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle
        of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace
        offerings unto the LORD.

017:006 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the
        LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and
        burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

017:007 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils,
        after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute
        for ever unto them throughout their generations.

017:008 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the
        house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you,
        that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,

017:009 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall
        be cut off from among his people.

017:010 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the
        strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of
        blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth
        blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

017:011 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it
        to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for
        it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.

017:012 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you
        shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth
        among you eat blood.

017:013 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of
        the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and
        catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even
        pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.

017:014 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the
        life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye
        shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all
        flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut
        off.

017:015 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that
        which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own
        country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and
        bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then
        shall he be clean.

017:016 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall
        bear his iniquity.

018:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

018:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the
        LORD your God.

018:003 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall
        ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither
        I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their
        ordinances.

018:004 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk
        therein: I am the LORD your God.

018:005 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which
        if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.

018:006 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him,
        to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.

018:007 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,
        shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not
        uncover her nakedness.

018:008 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it
        is thy father's nakedness.

018:009 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or
        daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born
        abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

018:010 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's
        daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for
        theirs is thine own nakedness.

018:011 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy
        father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her
        nakedness.

018:012 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister:
        she is thy father's near kinswoman.

018:013 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister:
        for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.

018:014 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother,
        thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.

018:015 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law:
        she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

018:016 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it
        is thy brother's nakedness.

018:017 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her
        daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her
        daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are
        her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.

018:018 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to
        uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.

018:019 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her
        nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.

018:020 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's
        wife, to defile thyself with her.

018:021 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire
        to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I
        am the LORD.

018:022 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
        abomination.

018:023 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself
        therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie
        down thereto: it is confusion.

018:024 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all
        these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:

018:025 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity
        thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her
        inhabitants.

018:026 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and
        shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of
        your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:

018:027 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done,
        which were before you, and the land is defiled;)

018:028 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it
        spued out the nations that were before you.

018:029 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the
        souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their
        people.

018:030 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any
        one of these abominable customs, which were committed before
        you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD
        your God.

019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

019:002 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and
        say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am
        holy.

019:003 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep
        my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.

019:004 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I
        am the LORD your God.

019:005 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD,
        ye shall offer it at your own will.

019:006 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow:
        and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in
        the fire.

019:007 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable;
        it shall not be accepted.

019:008 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,
        because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and
        that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

019:009 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not
        wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou
        gather the gleanings of thy harvest.

019:010 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou
        gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for
        the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.

019:011 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to
        another.

019:012 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
        profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

019:013 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the
        wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night
        until the morning.

019:014 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
        the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.

019:015 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not
        respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the
        mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

019:016 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy
        people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy
        neighbour; I am the LORD.

019:017 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in
        any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

019:018 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the
        children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as
        thyself: I am the LORD.

019:019 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle
        gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with
        mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and
        woollen come upon thee.

019:020 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,
        betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom
        given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to
        death, because she was not free.

019:021 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto
        the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for
        a trespass offering.

019:022 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
        the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he
        hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven
        him.

019:023 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted
        all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit
        thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as
        uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.

019:024 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to
        praise the LORD withal.

019:025 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that
        it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your
        God.

019:026 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye
        use enchantment, nor observe times.

019:027 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt
        thou mar the corners of thy beard.

019:028 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor
        print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.

019:029 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore;
        lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of
        wickedness.

019:030 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
        the LORD.

019:031 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
        wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.

019:032 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face
        of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.

019:033 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not
        vex him.

019:034 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as
        one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye
        were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

019:035 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in
        weight, or in measure.

019:036 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin,
        shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out
        of the land of Egypt.

019:037 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my
        judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.

020:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

020:002 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he
        be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn
        in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall
        surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him
        with stones.

020:003 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
        from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto
        Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

020:004 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
        the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him
        not:

020:005 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his
        family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after
        him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

020:006 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,
        and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set
        my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his
        people.

020:007 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the
        LORD your God.

020:008 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD
        which sanctify you.

020:009 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
        surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother;
        his blood shall be upon him.

020:010 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife,
        even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife,
        the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

020:011 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered
        his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to
        death; their blood shall be upon them.

020:012 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall
        surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their
        blood shall be upon them.

020:013 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
        of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be
        put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

020:014 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness:
        they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be
        no wickedness among you.

020:015 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to
        death: and ye shall slay the beast.

020:016 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,
        thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be
        put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

020:017 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or
        his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his
        nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in
        the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's
        nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.

020:018 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
        shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain,
        and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of
        them shall be cut off from among their people.

020:019 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's
        sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near
        kin: they shall bear their iniquity.

020:020 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath
        uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin;
        they shall die childless.

020:021 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean
        thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall
        be childless.

020:022 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
        and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell
        therein, spue you not out.

020:023 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I
        cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and
        therefore I abhorred them.

020:024 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I
        will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with
        milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated
        you from other people.

020:025 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
        unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not
        make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any
        manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I
        have separated from you as unclean.

020:026 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have
        severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.

020:027 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a
        wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them
        with stones: their blood shall be upon them.

021:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons
        of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for
        the dead among his people:

021:002 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his
        mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his
        daughter, and for his brother.

021:003 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath
        had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

021:004 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his
        people, to profane himself.

021:005 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall
        they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any
        cuttings in their flesh.

021:006 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of
        their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the
        bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be
        holy.

021:007 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane;
        neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for
        he is holy unto his God.

021:008 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread
        of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which
        sanctify you, am holy.

021:009 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by
        playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be
        burnt with fire.

021:010 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose
        head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to
        put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his
        clothes;

021:011 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself
        for his father, or for his mother;

021:012 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the
        sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of
        his God is upon him: I am the LORD.

021:013 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

021:014 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these
        shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own
        people to wife.

021:015 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the
        LORD do sanctify him.

021:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

021:017 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their
        generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to
        offer the bread of his God.

021:018 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not
        approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose,
        or any thing superfluous,

021:019 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,

021:020 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye,
        or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

021:021 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest
        shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by
        fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the
        bread of his God.

021:022 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and
        of the holy.

021:023 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the
        altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my
        sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

021:024 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all
        the children of Israel.

022:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

022:002 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate
        themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and
        that they profane not my holy name in those things which they
        hallow unto me: I am the LORD.

022:003 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your
        generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the
        children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his
        uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my
        presence: I am the LORD.

022:004 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a
        running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he
        be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the
        dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;

022:005 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be
        made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness,
        whatsoever uncleanness he hath;

022:006 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until
        even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his
        flesh with water.

022:007 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall
        afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.

022:008 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall
        not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.

022:009 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin
        for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do
        sanctify them.

022:010 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of
        the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy
        thing.

022:011 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of
        it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his
        meat.

022:012 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she
        may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

022:013 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have
        no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her
        youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be
        no stranger eat thereof.

022:014 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall
        put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the
        priest with the holy thing.

022:015 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
        Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

022:016 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat
        their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

022:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

022:018 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children
        of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of
        Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his
        oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings,
        which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;

022:019 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the
        beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

022:020 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it
        shall not be acceptable for you.

022:021 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the
        LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves
        or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be
        no blemish therein.

022:022 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or
        scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an
        offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.

022:023 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or
        lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill
        offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

022:024 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or
        crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering
        thereof in your land.

022:025 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of
        your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them,
        and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

022:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

022:027 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then
        it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day
        and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by
        fire unto the LORD.

022:028 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her
        young both in one day.

022:029 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the
        LORD, offer it at your own will.

022:030 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of
        it until the morrow: I am the LORD.

022:031 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the
        LORD.

022:032 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed
        among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,

022:033 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I
        am the LORD.

023:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,
        Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to
        be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.

023:003 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the
        sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work
        therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.

023:004 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations,
        which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.

023:005 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's
        passover.

023:006 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of
        unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat
        unleavened bread.

023:007 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall
        do no servile work therein.

023:008 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD
        seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye
        shall do no servile work therein.

023:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap
        the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the
        firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:

023:011 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted
        for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave
        it.

023:012 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb
        without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto
        the LORD.

023:013 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine
        flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD
        for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of
        wine, the fourth part of an hin.

023:014 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green
        ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering
        unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your
        generations in all your dwellings.

023:015 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,
        from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering;
        seven sabbaths shall be complete:

023:016 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number
        fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the
        LORD.

023:017 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two
        tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken
        with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.

023:018 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish
        of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they
        shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat
        offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by
        fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.

023:019 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin
        offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of
        peace offerings.

023:020 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the
        firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two
        lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.

023:021 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an
        holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work
        therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings
        throughout your generations.

023:022 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make
        clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest,
        neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou
        shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the
        LORD your God.

023:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:024 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh
        month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath,
        a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.

023:025 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an
        offering made by fire unto the LORD.

023:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:027 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a
        day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you;
        and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by
        fire unto the LORD.

023:028 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of
        atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your
        God.

023:029 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that
        same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

023:030 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same
        day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.

023:031 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
        throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

023:032 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict
        your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even
        unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

023:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:034 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day
        of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for
        seven days unto the LORD.

023:035 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no
        servile work therein.

023:036 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the
        LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you;
        and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it
        is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.

023:037 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to
        be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto
        the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice,
        and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:

023:038 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and
        beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings,
        which ye give unto the LORD.

023:039 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
        gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto
        the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and
        on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.

023:040 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly
        trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees,
        and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD
        your God seven days.

023:041 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the
        year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye
        shall celebrate it in the seventh month.

023:042 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites
        born shall dwell in booths:

023:043 That your generations may know that I made the children of
        Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land
        of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

023:044 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of
        the LORD.

024:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

024:002 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure
        oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn
        continually.

024:003 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
        congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the
        morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for
        ever in your generations.

024:004 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the
        LORD continually.

024:005 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:
        two tenth deals shall be in one cake.

024:006 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the
        pure table before the LORD.

024:007 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it
        may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by
        fire unto the LORD.

024:008 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD
        continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an
        everlasting covenant.

024:009 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it
        in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the
        offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.

024:010 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an
        Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son
        of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together
        in the camp;

024:011 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the
        Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his
        mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the
        tribe of Dan:)

024:012 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be
        shewed them.

024:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

024:014 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all
        that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the
        congregation stone him.

024:015 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
        Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.

024:016 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely
        be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly
        stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the
        land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put
        to death.

024:017 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.

024:018 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for
        beast.

024:019 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath
        done, so shall it be done to him;

024:020 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath
        caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.

024:021 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that
        killeth a man, he shall be put to death.

024:022 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as
        for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.

024:023 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should
        bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him
        with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep
        a sabbath unto the LORD.

025:003 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt
        prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

025:004 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the
        land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy
        field, nor prune thy vineyard.

025:005 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
        not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for
        it is a year of rest unto the land.

025:006 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee,
        and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired
        servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.

025:007 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land,
        shall all the increase thereof be meat.

025:008 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
        times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of
        years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.

025:009 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on
        the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement
        shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

025:010 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
        throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it
        shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto
        his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.

025:011 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not
        sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor
        gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.

025:012 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat
        the increase thereof out of the field.

025:013 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
        possession.

025:014 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
        thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:

025:015 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt
        buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years
        of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:

025:016 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the
        price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou
        shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of
        the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.

025:017 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt
        fear thy God:for I am the LORD your God.

025:018 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and
        do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

025:019 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your
        fill, and dwell therein in safety.

025:020 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year?
        behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

025:021 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year,
        and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

025:022 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit
        until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of
        the old store.

025:023 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for
        ye are strangers and sojourners with me.

025:024 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
        redemption for the land.

025:025 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
        possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then
        shall he redeem that which his brother sold.

025:026 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to
        redeem it;

025:027 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore
        the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may
        return unto his possession.

025:028 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is
        sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until
        the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he
        shall return unto his possession.

025:029 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he
        may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a
        full year may he redeem it.

025:030 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year,
        then the house that is in the walled city shall be established
        for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it
        shall not go out in the jubile.

025:031 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
        them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may
        be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.

025:032 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of
        the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any
        time.

025:033 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was
        sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year
        of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are
        their possession among the children of Israel.

025:034 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
        for it is their perpetual possession.

025:035 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with
        thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a
        stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.

025:036 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that
        thy brother may live with thee.

025:037 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
        victuals for increase.

025:038 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
        land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your
        God.

025:039 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be
        sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a
        bondservant:

025:040 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
        thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.

025:041 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
        with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the
        possession of his fathers shall he return.

025:042 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the
        land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.

025:043 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
        God.

025:044 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
        shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them
        shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.

025:045 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn
        among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that
        are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be
        your possession.

025:046 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children
        after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be
        your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of
        Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.

025:047 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy
        brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto
        the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the
        stranger's family:

025:048 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his
        brethren may redeem him:

025:049 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any
        that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or
        if he be able, he may redeem himself.

025:050 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year
        that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price
        of his sale shall be according unto the number of years,
        according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with
        him.

025:051 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he
        shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money
        that he was bought for.

025:052 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile,
        then he shall count with him, and according unto his years
        shall he give him again the price of his redemption.

025:053 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the
        other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

025:054 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
        in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.

025:055 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
        servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am
        the LORD your God.

026:001 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you
        up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of
        stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD
        your God.

026:002 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
        the LORD.

026:003 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do
        them;

026:004 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall
        yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield
        their fruit.

026:005 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the
        vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat
        your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

026:006 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and
        none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of
        the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.

026:007 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before
        you by the sword.

026:008 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you
        shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall
        before you by the sword.

026:009 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and
        multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.

026:010 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of
        the new.

026:011 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor
        you.

026:012 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall
        be my people.

026:013 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
        land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have
        broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.

026:014 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
        commandments;

026:015 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my
        judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but
        that ye break my covenant:

026:016 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you
        terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume
        the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your
        seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

026:017 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain
        before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you;
        and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.

026:018 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I
        will punish you seven times more for your sins.

026:019 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
        heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:

026:020 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall
        not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land
        yield their fruits.

026:021 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me;
        I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to
        your sins.

026:022 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of
        your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in
        number; and your high ways shall be desolate.

026:023 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will
        walk contrary unto me;

026:024 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you
        yet seven times for your sins.

026:025 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the
        quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together
        within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and
        ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

026:026 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women
        shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you
        your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be
        satisfied.

026:027 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk
        contrary unto me;

026:028 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even
        I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

026:029 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
        daughters shall ye eat.

026:030 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,
        and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my
        soul shall abhor you.

026:031 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
        unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet
        odours.

026:032 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies
        which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

026:033 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
        sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your
        cities waste.

026:034 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
        desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the
        land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.

026:035 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not
        rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

026:036 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a
        faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and
        the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall
        flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none
        pursueth.

026:037 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a
        sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand
        before your enemies.

026:038 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your
        enemies shall eat you up.

026:039 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their
        iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of
        their fathers shall they pine away with them.

026:040 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of
        their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed
        against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;

026:041 And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have
        brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their
        uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the
        punishment of their iniquity:

026:042 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my
        covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I
        remember; and I will remember the land.

026:043 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
        sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they
        shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because,
        even because they despised my judgments, and because their
        soul abhorred my statutes.

026:044 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their
        enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them,
        to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them:
        for I am the LORD their God.

026:045 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
        ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in
        the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the
        LORD.

026:046 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
        made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by
        the hand of Moses.

027:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

027:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a
        man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the
        LORD by thy estimation.

027:003 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old
        even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty
        shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

027:004 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty
        shekels.

027:005 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old,
        then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and
        for the female ten shekels.

027:006 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then
        thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver,
        and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of
        silver.

027:007 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,
        then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the
        female ten shekels.

027:008 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
        himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him;
        according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value
        him.

027:009 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the
        LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be
        holy.

027:010 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a
        bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast,
        then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.

027:011 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
        sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast
        before the priest:

027:012 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as
        thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.

027:013 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth
        part thereof unto thy estimation.

027:014 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
        LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or
        bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

027:015 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he
        shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto
        it, and it shall be his.

027:016 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field
        of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to
        the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at
        fifty shekels of silver.

027:017 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to
        thy estimation it shall stand.

027:018 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest
        shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that
        remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be
        abated from thy estimation.

027:019 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem
        it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy
        estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.

027:020 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the
        field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

027:021 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy
        unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof
        shall be the priest's.

027:022 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath
        bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;

027:023 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy
        estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall
        give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the
        LORD.

027:024 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of
        whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the
        land did belong.

027:025 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of
        the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

027:026 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's
        firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or
        sheep: it is the LORD's.

027:027 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it
        according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of
        it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold
        according to thy estimation.

027:028 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto
        the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of
        the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every
        devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.

027:029 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be
        redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.

027:030 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the
        land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy
        unto the LORD.

027:031 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall
        add thereto the fifth part thereof.

027:032 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
        whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto
        the LORD.

027:033 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall
        he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the
        change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

027:034 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for
        the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

Book 04	Numbers

001:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
        the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the
        second month, in the second year after they were come out of
        the land of Egypt, saying,

001:002 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of
        Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers,
        with the number of their names, every male by their polls;

001:003 From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go
        forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by
        their armies.

001:004 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one
        head of the house of his fathers.

001:005 And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you:
        of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.

001:006 Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

001:007 Of Judah; Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

001:009 Of Zebulun; Eliab the son of Helon.

001:016 These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the
        tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.

001:017 And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by
        their names:

001:018 And they assembled all the congregation together on the first
        day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees
        after their families, by the house of their fathers, according
        to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
        by their polls.

001:019 As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the
        wilderness of Sinai.

001:020 And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their
        generations, after their families, by the house of their
        fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls,
        every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were

        were forty and six thousand and five hundred.

001:023 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Simeon,
        were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.

001:024 Of the children of Gad, by their generations, after their

001:025 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Gad,
        were forty and five thousand six hundred and fifty.

001:026 Of the children of Judah, by their generations, after their

        that were able to go forth to war;

001:027 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Judah,
        were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

001:028 Of the children of Issachar, by their generations, after their

        that were able to go forth to war;

001:029 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Issachar, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred.

001:030 Of the children of Zebulun, by their generations, after their

001:031 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Zebulun, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.

001:032 Of the children of Joseph, namely, of the children of Ephraim,
        by their generations, after their families, by the house of
        their fathers, according to the number of the names, from
        twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to
        war;

001:033 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred.

001:034 Of the children of Manasseh, by their generations, after their
        families, by the house of their fathers, according to the
        number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all
        that were able to go forth to war;

001:035 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Manasseh, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred.

001:036 Of the children of Benjamin, by their generations, after their

        that were able to go forth to war;

001:037 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Benjamin, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

001:038 Of the children of Dan, by their generations, after their
        families, by the house of their fathers, according to the
        number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all
        that were able to go forth to war;

001:039 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Dan,
        were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

001:040 Of the children of Asher, by their generations, after their

        that were able to go forth to war;

001:041 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Asher,
        were forty and one thousand and five hundred.

001:042 Of the children of Naphtali, throughout their generations,

        all that were able to go forth to war;

001:043 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.

001:044 These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron
        numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each
        one was for the house of his fathers.

001:045 So were all those that were numbered of the children of
        Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old
        and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;

001:046 Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and
        three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

001:047 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not
        numbered among them.

001:048 For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,

001:049 Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the
        sum of them among the children of Israel:

001:050 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of
        testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all
        things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and
        all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and
        shall encamp round about the tabernacle.

001:051 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall
        take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the
        Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh
        shall be put to death.

001:052 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man
        by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout
        their hosts.

001:053 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of
        testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the
        children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of
        the tabernacle of testimony.

001:054 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
        commanded Moses, so did they.

002:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

002:002 Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own
        standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off
        about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.

002:003 And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they
        of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their
        armies: and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of
        the children of Judah.

002:004 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
        threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

002:005 And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of
        Issachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of
        the children of Issachar.

002:006 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty
        and four thousand and four hundred.

002:007 Then the tribe of Zebulun: and Eliab the son of Helon shall be
        captain of the children of Zebulun.

002:008 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty
        and seven thousand and four hundred.

002:009 All that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred
        thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four
        hundred, throughout their armies. These shall first set forth.

002:010 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben
        according to their armies: and the captain of the children of
        Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.

002:011 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty
        and six thousand and five hundred.

002:012 And those which pitch by him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and
        the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the
        son of Zurishaddai.

002:013 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
        and nine thousand and three hundred.

002:014 Then the tribe of Gad: and the captain of the sons of Gad
        shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.

002:015 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
        and five thousand and six hundred and fifty.

002:016 All that were numbered in the camp of Reuben were an hundred
        thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and
        fifty, throughout their armies. And they shall set forth in
        the second rank.

002:017 Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with
        the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp: as they
        encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by
        their standards.

002:018 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim
        according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of
        Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.

002:019 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
        thousand and five hundred.

002:020 And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh: and the captain of
        the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of
        Pedahzur.

002:021 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
        thirty and two thousand and two hundred.

002:022 Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the captain of the sons of
        Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.

002:023 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
        thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

002:024 All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were an hundred
        thousand and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their
        armies. And they shall go forward in the third rank.

002:025 The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by
        their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan shall be
        Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

002:026 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
        threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

002:027 And those that encamp by him shall be the tribe of Asher: and
        the captain of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son
        of Ocran.

002:028 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
        and one thousand and five hundred.

002:029 Then the tribe of Naphtali: and the captain of the children of
        Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.

002:030 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
        and three thousand and four hundred.

002:031 All they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred
        thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They
        shall go hindmost with their standards.

002:032 These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel
        by the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of
        the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and
        three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

002:033 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of
        Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

002:034 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
        commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so
        they set forward, every one after their families, according to
        the house of their fathers.

003:001 These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day
        that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.

003:002 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the
        firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

003:003 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which
        were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's
        office.

003:004 And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered
        strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and
        they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in
        the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.

003:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

003:006 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron
        the priest, that they may minister unto him.

003:007 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
        congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do
        the service of the tabernacle.

003:008 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of
        the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to
        do the service of the tabernacle.

003:009 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons:
        they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.

003:010 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait
        on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh
        shall be put to death.

003:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

003:012 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the
        children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth
        the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites
        shall be mine;

003:013 Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I
        smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto
        me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall
        they be: I am the LORD.

003:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,
        saying,

003:015 Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers,
        by their families: every male from a month old and upward
        shalt thou number them.

003:016 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as
        he was commanded.

003:017 And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and
        Kohath, and Merari.

003:018 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their
        families; Libni, and Shimei.

003:019 And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar,
        Hebron, and Uzziel.

003:020 And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi.
        These are the families of the Levites according to the house
        of their fathers.

003:021 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of
        the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites.

003:022 Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of
        all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that
        were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.

003:023 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the
        tabernacle westward.

003:024 And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites
        shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.

003:025 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the
        congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the
        covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation,

003:026 And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of
        the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round
        about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.

003:027 And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family
        of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the
        family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the
        Kohathites.

003:028 In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward,
        were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the
        sanctuary.

003:029 The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of
        the tabernacle southward.

003:030 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
        the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

003:031 And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the
        candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary
        wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service
        thereof.

003:032 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over
        the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that
        keep the charge of the sanctuary.

003:033 Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of
        the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.

003:034 And those that were numbered of them, according to the number
        of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six
        thousand and two hundred.

003:035 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
        Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the
        side of the tabernacle northward.

003:036 And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall
        be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the
        pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels
        thereof, and all that serveth thereto,

003:037 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
        and their pins, and their cords.

003:038 But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east,
        even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall
        be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the
        sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the
        stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

003:039 All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron
        numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their
        families, all the males from a month old and upward, were
        twenty and two thousand.

003:040 And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the
        males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward,
        and take the number of their names.

003:041 And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead
        of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the
        cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the
        cattle of the children of Israel.

003:042 And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the
        firstborn among the children of Israel.

003:043 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a
        month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them,
        were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and
        thirteen.

003:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

003:045 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the
        children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of
        their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD.

003:046 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and
        threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of
        Israel, which are more than the Levites;

003:047 Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after
        the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel
        is twenty gerahs:)

003:048 And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of
        them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.

003:049 And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and
        above them that were redeemed by the Levites:

003:050 Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money;
        a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels,
        after the shekel of the sanctuary:

003:051 And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron
        and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the
        LORD commanded Moses.

004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

004:002 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of
        Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers,

004:003 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old,
        all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle
        of the congregation.

004:004 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the
        tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things:

004:005 And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his
        sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover
        the ark of testimony with it:

004:006 And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and
        shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in
        the staves thereof.

004:007 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of
        blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the
        bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread
        shall be thereon:

004:008 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover
        the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in
        the staves thereof.

004:009 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick
        of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his
        snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they
        minister unto it:

004:010 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a
        covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.

004:011 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue,
        and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put
        to the staves thereof:

004:012 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith
        they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of
        blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and
        shall put them on a bar:

004:013 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread
        a purple cloth thereon:

004:014 And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith
        they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and
        the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and
        they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and
        put to the staves of it.

004:015 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
        sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp
        is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come
        to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they
        die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the
        tabernacle of the congregation.

004:016 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
        pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and
        the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the
        oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is,
        in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.

004:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying,

004:018 Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites
        from among the Levites:

004:019 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when
        they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons
        shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to
        his burden:

004:020 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are
        covered, lest they die.

004:021 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

004:022 Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the
        houses of their fathers, by their families;

004:023 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt
        thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to
        do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:024 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to
        serve, and for burdens:

004:025 And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the
        tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering
        of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging
        for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,

004:026 And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of
        the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the
        altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of
        their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they
        serve.

004:027 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the
        service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens,
        and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in
        charge all their burdens.

004:028 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in
        the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be
        under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

004:029 As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their
        families, by the house of their fathers;

004:030 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old
        shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the
        service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:031 And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their
        service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of
        the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof,
        and sockets thereof,

004:032 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
        and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments,
        and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the
        instruments of the charge of their burden.

004:033 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
        according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the
        congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the
        priest.

004:034 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered
        the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the
        house of their fathers,

004:035 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
        every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
        tabernacle of the congregation:

004:036 And those that were numbered of them by their families were
        two thousand seven hundred and fifty.

004:037 These were they that were numbered of the families of the
        Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
        congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to
        the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

004:038 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon,
        throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers,

004:039 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
        every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
        tabernacle of the congregation,

004:040 Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their
        families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and
        six hundred and thirty.

004:041 These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons
        of Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of
        the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to
        the commandment of the LORD.

004:042 And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
        Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their
        fathers,

004:043 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
        every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
        tabernacle of the congregation,

004:044 Even those that were numbered of them after their families,
        were three thousand and two hundred.

004:045 These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons
        of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word
        of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

004:046 All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and
        Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families,
        and after the house of their fathers,

004:047 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
        every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the
        service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:048 Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and
        five hundred and fourscore,

004:049 According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by
        the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and
        according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as
        the LORD commanded Moses.

005:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

005:002 Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp
        every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever
        is defiled by the dead:

005:003 Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall
        ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst
        whereof I dwell.

005:004 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without
        the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of
        Israel.

005:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

005:006 Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall
        commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the
        LORD, and that person be guilty;

005:007 Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he
        shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and
        add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him
        against whom he hath trespassed.

005:008 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass
        unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to
        the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an
        atonement shall be made for him.

005:009 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of
        Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

005:010 And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any
        man giveth the priest, it shall be his.

005:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

005:012 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
        man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,

005:013 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes
        of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and
        there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the
        manner;

005:014 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of
        his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy
        come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not
        defiled:

005:015 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he
        shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah
        of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put
        frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an
        offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

005:016 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the
        LORD:

005:017 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and
        of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest
        shall take, and put it into the water:

005:018 And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and
        uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in
        her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest
        shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the
        curse:

005:019 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the
        woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not
        gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband,
        be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:

005:020 But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband,
        and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee
        beside thine husband:

005:021 Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of
        cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD
        make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD
        doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;

005:022 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy
        bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And
        the woman shall say, Amen, amen.

005:023 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he
        shall blot them out with the bitter water:

005:024 And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that
        causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall
        enter into her, and become bitter.

005:025 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the
        woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and
        offer it upon the altar:

005:026 And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the
        memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward
        shall cause the woman to drink the water.

005:027 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall
        come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass
        against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse
        shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall
        swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse
        among her people.

005:028 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall
        be free, and shall conceive seed.

005:029 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to
        another instead of her husband, and is defiled;

005:030 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be
        jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the
        LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.

005:031 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman
        shall bear her iniquity.

006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When
        either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of
        a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the LORD:

006:003 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and
        shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink,
        neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist
        grapes, or dried.

006:004 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is
        made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

006:005 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor
        come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which
        he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and
        shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.

006:006 All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall
        come at no dead body.

006:007 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his
        mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die:
        because the consecration of his God is upon his head.

006:008 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.

006:009 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled
        the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in
        the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave
        it.

006:010 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
        pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation:

006:011 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
        other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for
        that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that
        same day.

006:012 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his
        separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a
        trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be
        lost, because his separation was defiled.

006:013 And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his
        separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation:

006:014 And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of
        the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one
        ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering,
        and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,

006:015 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled
        with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil,
        and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.

006:016 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall
        offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:

006:017 And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings
        unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest
        shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.

006:018 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the
        door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the
        hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire
        which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

006:019 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and
        one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened
        wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite,
        after the hair of his separation is shaven:

006:020 And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the
        LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and
        heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.

006:021 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his
        offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that
        his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he
        must do after the law of his separation.

006:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:023 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye
        shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,

006:024 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:

006:025 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
        thee:

006:026 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee
        peace.

006:027 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I
        will bless them.

007:001 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
        tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all
        the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels
        thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;

007:002 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their
        fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over
        them that were numbered, offered:

007:003 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered
        wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and
        for each one an ox: and they brought them before the
        tabernacle.

007:004 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

007:005 Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the
        tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto
        the Levites, to every man according to his service.

007:006 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
        Levites.

007:007 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon,
        according to their service:

007:008 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of
        Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of
        Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

007:009 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service
        of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear
        upon their shoulders.

007:010 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day
        that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering
        before the altar.

007:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering,
        each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

007:012 And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the
        son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah:

007:013 And his offering was one silver charger, the weight thereof
        was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy
        shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them were

007:089 And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the
        congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one
        speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the
        ark of testimony, from between the two cherubims: and he spake
        unto him.

008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

008:002 Speak unto Aaron and say unto him, When thou lightest the
        lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the
        candlestick.

008:003 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against
        the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:004 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the
        shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work:
        according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so
        he made the candlestick.

008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

008:006 Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and
        cleanse them.

008:007 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle
        water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their
        flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves
        clean.

008:008 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering,
        even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock
        shalt thou take for a sin offering.

008:009 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
        congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the
        children of Israel together:

008:010 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the
        children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:

008:011 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an
        offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the
        service of the LORD.

008:012 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
        bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and
        the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an
        atonement for the Levites.

008:013 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his
        sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD.

008:014 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children
        of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.

008:015 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of
        the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse
        them, and offer them for an offering.

008:016 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of
        Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of
        the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them
        unto me.

008:017 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both
        man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the
        land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

008:018 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the
        children of Israel.

008:019 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his
        sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of
        the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation,
        and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that
        there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the
        children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

008:020 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children
        of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD
        commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of
        Israel unto them.

008:021 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes;
        and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and
        Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.

008:022 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the
        tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his
        sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites,
        so did they unto them.

008:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

008:024 This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and
        five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the
        service of the tabernacle of the congregation:

008:025 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon
        the service thereof, and shall serve no more:

008:026 But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of
        the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service.
        Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.

009:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
        the first month of the second year after they were come out of
        the land of Egypt, saying,

009:002 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his
        appointed season.

009:003 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it
        in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and
        according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

009:004 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should
        keep the passover.

009:005 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
        month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all
        that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.

009:006 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body
        of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day:
        and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:

009:007 And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body
        of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an
        offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the
        children of Israel?

009:008 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what
        the LORD will command concerning you.

009:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

009:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you
        or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead
        body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the
        passover unto the LORD.

009:011 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
        it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

009:012 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any
        bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover
        they shall keep it.

009:013 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and
        forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be
        cut off from among his people: because he brought not the
        offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall
        bear his sin.

009:014 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
        passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the
        passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do:
        ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for
        him that was born in the land.

009:015 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
        covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and
        at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the
        appearance of fire, until the morning.

009:016 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the
        appearance of fire by night.

009:017 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then
        after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place
        where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched
        their tents.

009:018 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel
        journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as
        long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in
        their tents.

009:019 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,
        then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and
        journeyed not.

009:020 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the
        tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they
        abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the
        LORD they journeyed.

009:021 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the
        morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then
        they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the
        cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

009:022 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the
        cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the
        children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not:
        but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

009:023 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and
        at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the
        charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand
        of Moses.

010:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

010:002 Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou
        make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the
        assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.

010:003 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall
        assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of
        the congregation.

010:004 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which
        are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves
        unto thee.

010:005 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east
        parts shall go forward.

010:006 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie
        on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an
        alarm for their journeys.

010:007 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall
        blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.

010:008 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the
        trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever
        throughout your generations.

010:009 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that
        oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets;
        and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye
        shall be saved from your enemies.

010:010 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and
        in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the
        trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of
        your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial
        before your God: I am the LORD your God.

010:011 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month,
        in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the
        tabernacle of the testimony.

010:012 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
        wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of
        Paran.

010:013 And they first took their journey according to the commandment
        of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

010:014 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the
        children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host
        was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

010:015 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
        Nethaneel the son of Zuar.

010:016 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was
        Eliab the son of Helon.

010:017 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and
        the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.

010:018 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according
        to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of
        Shedeur.

010:019 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
        Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

010:020 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was
        Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

010:021 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the
        other did set up the tabernacle against they came.

010:022 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set
        forward according to their armies: and over his host was
        Elishama the son of Ammihud.

010:023 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was
        Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

010:024 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
        Abidan the son of Gideoni.

010:025 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set
        forward, which was the rereward of all the camps throughout
        their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of
        Ammishaddai.

010:026 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was
        Pagiel the son of Ocran.

010:027 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was
        Ahira the son of Enan.

010:028 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according
        to their armies, when they set forward.

010:029 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,
        Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of
        which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us,
        and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good
        concerning Israel.

010:030 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine
        own land, and to my kindred.

010:031 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou
        knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou
        mayest be to us instead of eyes.

010:032 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that
        what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do
        unto thee.

010:033 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days'
        journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before
        them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place
        for them.

010:034 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went
        out of the camp.

010:035 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses
        said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and
        let them that hate thee flee before thee.

010:036 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many
        thousands of Israel.

011:001 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and
        the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of
        the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the
        uttermost parts of the camp.

011:002 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto
        the LORD, the fire was quenched.

011:003 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire
        of the LORD burnt among them.

011:004 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and
        the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall
        give us flesh to eat?

011:005 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the
        cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and
        the garlick:

011:006 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all,
        beside this manna, before our eyes.

011:007 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
        the colour of bdellium.

011:008 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
        mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made
        cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh
        oil.

011:009 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna
        fell upon it.

011:010 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
        every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD
        was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.

011:011 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted
        thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy
        sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?

011:012 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that
        thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a
        nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which
        thou swarest unto their fathers?

011:013 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for
        they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

011:014 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
        heavy for me.

011:015 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
        hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see
        my wretchedness.

011:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of
        the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of
        the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the
        tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with
        thee.

011:017 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take
        of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them;
        and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that
        thou bear it not thyself alone.

011:018 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
        morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears
        of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it
        was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you
        flesh, and ye shall eat.

011:019 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
        ten days, nor twenty days;

011:020 But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils,
        and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised
        the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying,
        Why came we forth out of Egypt?

011:021 And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred
        thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh,
        that they may eat a whole month.

011:022 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
        them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together
        for them, to suffice them?

011:023 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short?
        thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto
        thee or not.

011:024 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
        and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and
        set them round about the tabernacle.

011:025 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and
        took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the
        seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit
        rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.

011:026 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
        one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit
        rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but
        went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the
        camp.

011:027 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
        Medad do prophesy in the camp.

011:028 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his
        young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

011:029 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
        that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD
        would put his spirit upon them!

011:030 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

011:031 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
        from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a
        day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on
        the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two
        cubits high upon the face of the earth.

011:032 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
        all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that
        gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all
        abroad for themselves round about the camp.

011:033 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
        chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people,
        and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

011:034 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because
        there they buried the people that lusted.

011:035 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
        and abode at Hazeroth.

012:001 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the
        Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an
        Ethiopian woman.

012:002 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath
        he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.

012:003 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were
        upon the face of the earth.)

012:004 And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and
        unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the
        congregation. And they three came out.

012:005 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood
        in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam:
        and they both came forth.

012:006 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among
        you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision,
        and will speak unto him in a dream.

012:007 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.

012:008 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not
        in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he
        behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my
        servant Moses?

012:009 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he
        departed.

012:010 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,
        Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon
        Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.

012:011 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay
        not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and
        wherein we have sinned.

012:012 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed
        when he cometh out of his mother's womb.

012:013 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
        beseech thee.

012:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in
        her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be
        shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be
        received in again.

012:015 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the
        people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

012:016 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in
        the wilderness of Paran.

013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

013:002 Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which
        I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their
        fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.

013:003 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the
        wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children
        of Israel.

013:004 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua
        the son of Zaccur.

013:005 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

013:006 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

013:007 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

013:008 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

013:009 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

013:010 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

013:011 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh,
        Gaddi the son of Susi.

013:012 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

013:013 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

013:014 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

013:015 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

013:016 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
        land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.

013:017 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said
        unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the
        mountain:

013:018 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth
        therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;

013:019 And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or
        bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in
        tents, or in strong holds;

013:020 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there
        be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring
        of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the
        firstripe grapes.

013:021 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of
        Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

013:022 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
        Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now
        Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

013:023 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from
        thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it
        between two upon a staff; and they brought of the
        pomegranates, and of the figs.

013:024 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster
        of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.

013:025 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

013:026 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
        congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of
        Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto
        all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.

013:027 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither
        thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey;
        and this is the fruit of it.

013:028 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and
        the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the
        children of Anak there.

013:029 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the
        Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the
        mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the
        coast of Jordan.

013:030 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go
        up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome
        it.

013:031 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go
        up against the people; for they are stronger than we.

013:032 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
        searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land,
        through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth
        up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in
        it are men of a great stature.

013:033 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of
        the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and
        so we were in their sight.

014:001 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and
        the people wept that night.

014:002 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and
        against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them,
        Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God
        we had died in this wilderness!

014:003 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall
        by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a
        prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?

014:004 And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let
        us return into Egypt.

014:005 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the
        assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.

014:006 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
        which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:

014:007 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel,
        saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an
        exceeding good land.

014:008 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this
        land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and
        honey.

014:009 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people
        of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is
        departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.

014:010 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the
        glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the
        congregation before all the children of Israel.

014:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people
        provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for
        all the signs which I have shewed among them?

014:012 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them,
        and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

014:013 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear
        it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from
        among them;)

014:014 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for
        they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that
        thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth
        over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a
        pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.

014:015 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the
        nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,

014:016 Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the
        land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in
        the wilderness.

014:017 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great,
        according as thou hast spoken, saying,

014:018 The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving
        iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the
        guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
        unto the third and fourth generation.

014:019 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according
        unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven
        this people, from Egypt even until now.

014:020 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:

014:021 But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the
        glory of the LORD.

014:022 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my
        miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have
        tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my
        voice;

014:023 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their
        fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:

014:024 But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him,
        and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land
        whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.

014:025 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
        Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way
        of the Red sea.

014:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

014:027 How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which
        murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children
        of Israel, which they murmur against me.

014:028 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have
        spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:

014:029 Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were
        numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty
        years old and upward which have murmured against me.

014:030 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I
        sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of
        Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

014:031 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them
        will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have
        despised.

014:032 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this
        wilderness.

014:033 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,
        and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the
        wilderness.

014:034 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land,
        even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your
        iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of
        promise.

014:035 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
        congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this
        wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

014:036 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who
        returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him,
        by bringing up a slander upon the land,

014:037 Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the
        land, died by the plague before the LORD.

014:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
        which were of the men that went to search the land, lived
        still.

014:039 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:
        and the people mourned greatly.

014:040 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into
        the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go
        up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have
        sinned.

014:041 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
        of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.

014:042 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not
        smitten before your enemies.

014:043 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you,
        and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away
        from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.

014:044 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the
        ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out
        of the camp.

014:045 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt
        in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto
        Hormah.

015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto
        you,

015:003 And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt
        offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill
        offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour
        unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:

015:004 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a
        meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth
        part of an hin of oil.

015:005 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering
        shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for
        one lamb.

015:006 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
        deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.

015:007 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an
        hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

015:008 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for
        a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the
        LORD:

015:009 Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three
        tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

015:010 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,
        for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

015:011 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for
        a lamb, or a kid.

015:012 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do
        to every one according to their number.

015:013 All that are born of the country shall do these things after
        this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet
        savour unto the LORD.

015:014 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you
        in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire,
        of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.

015:015 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and
        also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance
        for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger
        be before the LORD.

015:016 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger
        that sojourneth with you.

015:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

015:018 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        come into the land whither I bring you,

015:019 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land,
        ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.

015:020 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an
        heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the
        threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.

015:021 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an
        heave offering in your generations.

015:022 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,
        which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,

015:023 Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of
        Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and
        henceforward among your generations;

015:024 Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without
        the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation
        shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a
        sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his
        drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the
        goats for a sin offering.

015:025 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the
        congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be
        forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their
        offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their
        sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:

015:026 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children
        of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing
        all the people were in ignorance.

015:027 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a
        she goat of the first year for a sin offering.

015:028 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that
        sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the
        LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven
        him.

015:029 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,
        both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and
        for the stranger that sojourneth among them.

015:030 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be
        born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the
        LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

015:031 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken
        his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his
        iniquity shall be upon him.

015:032 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they
        found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.

015:033 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto
        Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

015:034 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what
        should be done to him.

015:035 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to
        death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones
        without the camp.

015:036 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and
        stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

015:037 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

015:038 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make
        them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their
        generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders
        a ribband of blue:

015:039 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon
        it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do
        them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own
        eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:

015:040 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy
        unto your God.

015:041 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
        Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.

016:001 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of
        Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the
        son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:

016:002 And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of
        Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous
        in the congregation, men of renown:

016:003 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and
        against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you,
        seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and
        the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
        above the congregation of the LORD?

016:004 And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:

016:005 And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even
        to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and
        will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath
        chosen will he cause to come near unto him.

016:006 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;

016:007 And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD
        to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth
        choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons
        of Levi.

016:008 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:

016:009 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel
        hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring
        you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the
        LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto
        them?

016:010 And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the
        sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?

016:011 For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered
        together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur
        against him?

016:012 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab:
        which said, We will not come up:

016:013 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land
        that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the
        wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over
        us?

016:014 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth
        with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and
        vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will
        not come up.

016:015 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not
        thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them,
        neither have I hurt one of them.

016:016 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before
        the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:

016:017 And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and
        bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and
        fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.

016:018 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and
        laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle
        of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.

016:019 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the
        door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of
        the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.

016:020 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

016:021 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
        consume them in a moment.

016:022 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of
        the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be
        wroth with all the congregation?

016:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

016:024 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
        tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

016:025 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
        elders of Israel followed him.

016:026 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray
        you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of
        their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.

016:027 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and
        Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and
        stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their
        sons, and their little children.

016:028 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent
        me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own
        mind.

016:029 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be
        visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath
        not sent me.

016:030 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her
        mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them,
        and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand
        that these men have provoked the LORD.

016:031 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all
        these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under
        them:

016:032 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and
        their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and
        all their goods.

016:033 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into
        the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished
        from among the congregation.

016:034 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of
        them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.

016:035 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two
        hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

016:036 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

016:037 Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take
        up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire
        yonder; for they are hallowed.

016:038 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them
        make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they
        offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and
        they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.

016:039 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they
        that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates
        for a covering of the altar:

016:040 To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no
        stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to
        offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as
        his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.

016:041 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of
        Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye
        have killed the people of the LORD.

016:042 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered
        against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the
        tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered
        it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.

016:043 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

016:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

016:045 Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume
        them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.

016:046 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein
        from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto
        the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is
        wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.

016:047 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of
        the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the
        people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the
        people.

016:048 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague
        was stayed.

016:049 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
        seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of
        Korah.

016:050 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle
        of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

017:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of
        them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all
        their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve
        rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.

017:003 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for
        one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

017:004 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the
        congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

017:005 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall
        choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the
        murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur
        against you.

017:006 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of
        their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one,
        according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the
        rod of Aaron was among their rods.

017:007 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle
        of witness.

017:008 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
        tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the
        house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed
        blossoms, and yielded almonds.

017:009 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto
        all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every
        man his rod.

017:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before
        the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and
        thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they
        die not.

017:011 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.

017:012 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold,
        we die, we perish, we all perish.

017:013 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the
        LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

018:001 And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy
        father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the
        sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the
        iniquity of your priesthood.

018:002 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy
        father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto
        thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee
        shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.

018:003 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the
        tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the
        sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.

018:004 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the
        tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.

018:005 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge
        of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the
        children of Israel.

018:006 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from
        among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift
        for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

018:007 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's
        office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and
        ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as
        a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be
        put to death.

018:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee
        the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things
        of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by
        reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for
        ever.

018:009 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the
        fire: every oblation of their's, every meat offering of
        their's, and every sin offering of their's, and every trespass
        offering of their's which they shall render unto me, shall be
        most holy for thee and for thy sons.

018:010 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat
        it: it shall be holy unto thee.

018:011 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all
        the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given
        them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with
        thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy
        house shall eat of it.

018:012 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of
        the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto
        the LORD, them have I given thee.

018:013 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall
        bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean
        in thine house shall eat of it.

018:014 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.

018:015 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they
        bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be
        thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely
        redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.

018:016 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
        redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five
        shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty
        gerahs.

018:017 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or
        the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy:
        thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn
        their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour
        unto the LORD.

018:018 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and
        as the right shoulder are thine.

018:019 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children
        of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons
        and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a
        covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy
        seed with thee.

018:020 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance
        in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I
        am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of
        Israel.

018:021 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth
        in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they
        serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

018:022 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
        tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.

018:023 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be
        a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the
        children of Israel they have no inheritance.

018:024 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as
        an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites
        to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the
        children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.

018:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

018:026 Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take
        of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you
        from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an
        heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the
        tithe.

018:027 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as
        though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the
        fulness of the winepress.

018:028 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of
        all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel;
        and ye shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron
        the priest.

018:029 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of
        the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part
        thereof out of it.

018:030 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the
        best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the
        Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the
        increase of the winepress.

018:031 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households:
        for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of
        the congregation.

018:032 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved
        from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy
        things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.

019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

019:002 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath
        commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that
        they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no
        blemish, and upon which never came yoke:

019:003 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may
        bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her
        before his face:

019:004 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his
        finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the
        tabernacle of the congregation seven times:

019:005 And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her
        flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:

019:006 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet,
        and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

019:007 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his
        flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and
        the priest shall be unclean until the even.

019:008 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and
        bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.

019:009 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the
        heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and
        it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of
        Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for
        sin.

019:010 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
        clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto
        the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth
        among them, for a statute for ever.

019:011 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean
        seven days.

019:012 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the
        seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself
        the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.

019:013 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and
        purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD;
        and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water
        of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean;
        his uncleanness is yet upon him.

019:014 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come
        into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean
        seven days.

019:015 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it,
        is unclean.

019:016 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the
        open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave,
        shall be unclean seven days.

019:017 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the
        burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall
        be put thereto in a vessel:

019:018 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water,
        and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and
        upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a
        bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:

019:019 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the
        third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he
        shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself
        in water, and shall be clean at even.

019:020 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify
        himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the
        congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the
        LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon
        him; he is unclean.

019:021 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that
        sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and
        he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean
        until even.

019:022 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean;
        and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.

020:001 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
        into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people
        abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.

020:002 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered
        themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

020:003 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God
        that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!

020:004 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into
        this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?

020:005 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to
        bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or
        of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any
        water to drink.

020:006 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly
        unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they
        fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto
        them.

020:007 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

020:008 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and
        Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their
        eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring
        forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the
        congregation and their beasts drink.

020:009 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded
        him.

020:010 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before
        the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we
        fetch you water out of this rock?

020:011 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the
        rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the
        congregation drank, and their beasts also.

020:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed
        me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel,
        therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land
        which I have given them.

020:013 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel
        strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.

020:014 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
        Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail
        that hath befallen us:

020:015 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in
        Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our
        fathers:

020:016 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent
        an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold,
        we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:

020:017 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not
        pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither
        will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the
        king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the
        left, until we have passed thy borders.

020:018 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come
        out against thee with the sword.

020:019 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the
        high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I
        will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go
        through on my feet.

020:020 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out
        against him with much people, and with a strong hand.

020:021 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
        wherefore Israel turned away from him.

020:022 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
        journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

020:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the
        coast of the land of Edom, saying,

020:024 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not
        enter into the land which I have given unto the children of
        Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of
        Meribah.

020:025 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount
        Hor:

020:026 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his
        son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall
        die there.

020:027 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into
        mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.

020:028 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon
        Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount:
        and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

020:029 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they
        mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

021:001 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south,
        heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he
        fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.

021:002 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt
        indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly
        destroy their cities.

021:003 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered
        up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their
        cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.

021:004 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea,
        to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was
        much discouraged because of the way.

021:005 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore
        have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?
        for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our
        soul loatheth this light bread.

021:006 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they
        bit the people; and much people of Israel died.

021:007 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,
        for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray
        unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And
        Moses prayed for the people.

021:008 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and
        set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one
        that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

021:009 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and
        it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he
        beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

021:010 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

021:011 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in
        the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

021:012 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

021:013 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
        Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the
        coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab,
        between Moab and the Amorites.

021:014 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
        he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,

021:015 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the
        dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.

021:016 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof
        the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I
        will give them water.

021:017 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto
        it:

021:018 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged
        it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And
        from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:

021:019 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:

021:020 And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab,
        to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.

021:021 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
        saying,

021:022 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the
        fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters
        of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way,
        until we be past thy borders.

021:023 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:
        but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out
        against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and
        fought against Israel.

021:024 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed
        his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of
        Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.

021:025 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the
        cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages
        thereof.

021:026 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites,
        who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all
        his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.

021:027 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
        let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:

021:028 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city
        of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the
        high places of Arnon.

021:029 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he
        hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into
        captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.

021:030 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and
        we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto
        Medeba.

021:031 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

021:032 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
        thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

021:033 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the
        king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people,
        to the battle at Edrei.

021:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have
        delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land;
        and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
        Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

021:035 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until
        there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

022:001 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the
        plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

022:002 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to
        the Amorites.

022:003 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were
        many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of
        Israel.

022:004 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this
        company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh
        up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was
        king of the Moabites at that time.

022:005 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
        Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of
        his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people
        come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth,
        and they abide over against me:

022:006 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for
        they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that
        we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land:
        for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom
        thou cursest is cursed.

022:007 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with
        the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto
        Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.

022:008 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring
        you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the
        princes of Moab abode with Balaam.

022:009 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with
        thee?

022:010 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of
        Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,

022:011 Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth
        the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I
        shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.

022:012 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
        shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.

022:013 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes
        of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to
        give me leave to go with you.

022:014 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and
        said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

022:015 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable
        than they.

022:016 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the
        son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from
        coming unto me:

022:017 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do
        whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee,
        curse me this people.

022:018 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
        Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
        cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or
        more.

022:019 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that
        I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.

022:020 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the
        men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the
        word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.

022:021 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
        went with the princes of Moab.

022:022 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of
        the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he
        was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.

022:023 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and
        his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of
        the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to
        turn her into the way.

022:024 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a
        wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.

022:025 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself
        unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and
        he smote her again.

022:026 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow
        place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to
        the left.

022:027 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down
        under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the
        ass with a staff.

022:028 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
        Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me
        these three times?

022:029 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I
        would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill
        thee.

022:030 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which
        thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I
        ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

022:031 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel
        of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his
        hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.

022:032 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
        smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to
        withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:

022:033 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times:
        unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain
        thee, and saved her alive.

022:034 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for
        I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now
        therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.

022:035 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men:
        but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou
        shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

022:036 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
        him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon,
        which is in the utmost coast.

022:037 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee
        to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able
        indeed to promote thee to honour?

022:038 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I
        now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God
        putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.

022:039 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.

022:040 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to
        the princes that were with him.

022:041 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
        brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he
        might see the utmost part of the people.

023:001 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
        prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.

023:002 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam
        offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.

023:003 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I
        will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and
        whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an
        high place.

023:004 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared
        seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock
        and a ram.

023:005 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return
        unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

023:006 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt
        sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.

023:007 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab
        hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,
        saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.

023:008 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I
        defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?

023:009 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I
        behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be
        reckoned among the nations.

023:010 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
        part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let
        my last end be like his!

023:011 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I
        took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast
        blessed them altogether.

023:012 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that
        which the LORD hath put in my mouth?

023:013 And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto
        another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt
        see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all:
        and curse me them from thence.

023:014 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
        Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a
        ram on every altar.

023:015 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering,
        while I meet the LORD yonder.

023:016 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and
        said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.

023:017 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt
        offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said
        unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?

023:018 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and
        hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:

023:019 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man,
        that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it?
        or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

023:020 Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath
        blessed; and I cannot reverse it.

023:021 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
        perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the
        shout of a king is among them.

023:022 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength
        of an unicorn.

023:023 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there
        any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall
        be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

023:024 Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up
        himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of
        the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

023:025 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor
        bless them at all.

023:026 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
        saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?

023:027 And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring
        thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that
        thou mayest curse me them from thence.

023:028 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh
        toward Jeshimon.

023:029 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
        prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

023:030 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a
        ram on every altar.

024:001 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel,
        he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but
        he set his face toward the wilderness.

024:002 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in
        his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God
        came upon him.

024:003 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
        hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

024:004 He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the
        vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his
        eyes open:

024:005 How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O
        Israel!

024:006 As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the
        river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath
        planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.

024:007 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall
        be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and
        his kingdom shall be exalted.

024:008 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the
        strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his
        enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through
        with his arrows.

024:009 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who
        shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and
        cursed is he that curseth thee.

024:010 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his
        hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to
        curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed
        them these three times.

024:011 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote
        thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back
        from honour.

024:012 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers
        which thou sentest unto me, saying,

024:013 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
        cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either
        good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that
        will I speak?

024:014 And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I
        will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in
        the latter days.

024:015 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
        hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

024:016 He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the
        knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the
        Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:

024:017 I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not
        nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre
        shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab,
        and destroy all the children of Sheth.

024:018 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a
        possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.

024:019 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall
        destroy him that remaineth of the city.

024:020 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and
        said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end
        shall be that he perish for ever.

024:021 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and
        said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest
        in a rock.

024:022 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall
        carry thee away captive.

024:023 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live
        when God doeth this!

024:024 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall
        afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall
        perish for ever.

024:025 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and
        Balak also went his way.

025:001 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit
        whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

025:002 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods:
        and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.

025:003 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the
        LORD was kindled against Israel.

025:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the
        people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that
        the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.

025:005 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one
        his men that were joined unto Baalpeor.

025:006 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought
        unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses,
        and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of
        Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of
        the congregation.

025:007 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the
        priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and
        took a javelin in his hand;

025:008 And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust
        both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through
        her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of
        Israel.

025:009 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four
        thousand.

025:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

025:011 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
        hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while
        he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the
        children of Israel in my jealousy.

025:012 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:

025:013 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the
        covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous
        for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.

025:014 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was
        slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu,
        a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.

025:015 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was
        Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of
        a chief house in Midian.

025:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

025:017 Vex the Midianites, and smite them:

025:018 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have
        beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of
        Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which
        was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.

026:001 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto
        Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,

026:002 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of
        Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their
        fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.

026:003 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains
        of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

026:004 Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward;
        as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which
        went forth out of the land of Egypt.

026:005 Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben;
        Hanoch, of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu,
        the family of the Palluites:

        of the Carmites.

026:007 These are the families of the Reubenites: and they that were
        numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven
        hundred and thirty.

026:008 And the sons of Pallu; Eliab.

026:009 And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This is
        that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation,
        who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of
        Korah, when they strove against the LORD:

026:010 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together
        with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire
        devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.

026:011 Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.

        that were numbered of them, threescore thousand and five
        hundred.

026:028 The sons of Joseph after their families were Manasseh and
        Ephraim.

026:029 Of the sons of Manasseh: of Machir, the family of the
        Machirites: and Machir begat Gilead: of Gilead come the family
        of the Gileadites.

026:030 These are the sons of Gilead: of Jeezer, the family of the

        Ahiram, the family of the Ahiramites:

026:039 Of Shupham, the family of the Shuphamites: of Hupham, the
        family of the Huphamites.

026:040 And the sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: of Ard, the family
        of the Ardites: and of Naaman, the family of the Naamites.

026:041 These are the sons of Benjamin after their families: and they
        that were numbered of them were forty and five thousand and
        six hundred.

026:042 These are the sons of Dan after their families: of Shuham, the
        family of the Shuhamites. These are the families of Dan after
        their families.

026:043 All the families of the Shuhamites, according to those that
        were numbered of them, were threescore and four thousand and
        four hundred.

026:044 Of the children of Asher after their families: of Jimna, the
        family of the Jimnites: of Jesui, the family of the Jesuites:
        of Beriah, the family of the Beriites.

026:045 Of the sons of Beriah: of Heber, the family of the Heberites:
        of Malchiel, the family of the Malchielites.

026:046 And the name of the daughter of Asher was Sarah.

026:047 These are the families of the sons of Asher according to those
        that were numbered of them; who were fifty and three thousand
        and four hundred.

026:048 Of the sons of Naphtali after their families: of Jahzeel, the
        family of the Jahzeelites: of Guni, the family of the Gunites:

026:049 Of Jezer, the family of the Jezerites: of Shillem, the family
        of the Shillemites.

026:050 These are the families of Naphtali according to their
        families: and they that were numbered of them were forty and
        five thousand and four hundred.

026:051 These were the numbered of the children of Israel, six hundred
        thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty.

026:052 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

026:053 Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance
        according to the number of names.

026:054 To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou
        shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his
        inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of
        him.

026:055 Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to
        the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.

026:056 According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided
        between many and few.

026:057 And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after
        their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites: of
        Kohath, the family of the Kohathites: of Merari, the family of
        the Merarites.

026:058 These are the families of the Levites: the family of the
        Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the
        Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the
        Korathites. And Kohath begat Amram.

026:059 And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of
        Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt: and she bare unto
        Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.

026:060 And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and
        Ithamar.

026:061 And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire
        before the LORD.

026:062 And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three
        thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were
        not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was
        no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.

026:063 These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the
        priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of
        Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

026:064 But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and
        Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of
        Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.

026:065 For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the
        wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb
        the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

027:001 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the
        son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the
        families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the
        names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah,
        and Tirzah.

027:002 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest,
        and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door
        of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

027:003 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the
        company of them that gathered themselves together against the
        LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had
        no sons.

027:004 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his
        family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a
        possession among the brethren of our father.

027:005 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.

027:006 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

027:007 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely
        give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's
        brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father
        to pass unto them.

027:008 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a
        man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance
        to pass unto his daughter.

027:009 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance
        unto his brethren.

027:010 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance
        unto his father's brethren.

027:011 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his
        inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his
        family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the
        children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

027:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount
        Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children
        of Israel.

027:013 And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto
        thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.

027:014 For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin,
        in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water
        before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in
        the wilderness of Zin.

027:015 And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,

027:016 Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man
        over the congregation,

027:017 Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them,
        and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that
        the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no
        shepherd.

027:018 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun,
        a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;

027:019 And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
        congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

027:020 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the
        congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

027:021 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask
        counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at
        his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come
        in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all
        the congregation.

027:022 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua,
        and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
        congregation:

027:023 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the
        LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

028:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

028:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My
        offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a
        sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in
        their due season.

028:003 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by
        fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the
        first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt
        offering.

028:004 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other
        lamb shalt thou offer at even;

028:005 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering,
        mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.

028:006 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount
        Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the
        LORD.

028:007 And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an
        hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the
        strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.

028:008 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat
        offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof,
        thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet
        savour unto the LORD.

028:009 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without
        spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering,
        mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:

028:010 This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the
        continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

028:011 And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt
        offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven
        lambs of the first year without spot;

028:012 And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled
        with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a
        meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;

028:013 And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat
        offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet
        savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

028:014 And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a
        bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth
        part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of
        every month throughout the months of the year.

028:015 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD
        shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his
        drink offering.

028:016 And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover
        of the LORD.

028:017 And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven
        days shall unleavened bread be eaten.

028:018 In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no
        manner of servile work therein:

028:019 But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt
        offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and
        seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without
        blemish:

028:020 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil:
        three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth
        deals for a ram;

028:021 A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb,
        throughout the seven lambs:

028:022 And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.

028:023 Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning,
        which is for a continual burnt offering.

028:024 After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven
        days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet
        savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual
        burnt offering, and his drink offering.

028:025 And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye
        shall do no servile work.

028:026 Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat
        offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have
        an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:

028:027 But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto
        the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the
        first year;

028:028 And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth
        deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,

028:029 A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven
        lambs;

028:030 And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.

028:031 Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and
        his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish)
        and their drink offerings.

029:001 And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye
        shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:
        it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.

029:002 And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto
        the LORD; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the
        first year without blemish:

029:003 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
        three tenth deals for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a
        ram,

029:004 And one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

029:005 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an
        atonement for you:

029:006 Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering,
        and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their
        drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet
        savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

029:007 And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an
        holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall
        not do any work therein:

029:008 But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet
        savour; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the
        first year; they shall be unto you without blemish:

029:009 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
        three tenth deals to a bullock, and two tenth deals to one
        ram,

029:010 A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

029:011 One kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the sin
        offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and
        the meat offering of it, and their drink offerings.

029:012 And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an
        holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall
        keep a feast unto the LORD seven days:

029:013 And ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire,
        of a sweet savour unto the LORD; thirteen young bullocks, two
        rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be
        without blemish:

029:014 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
        three tenth deals unto every bullock of the thirteen bullocks,
        two tenth deals to each ram of the two rams,

029:015 And a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourteen lambs:

029:016 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
        continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink
        offering.

029:017 And on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks,
        two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without spot:

029:018 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:019 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
        continual burnt offering, and the meat offering thereof, and
        their drink offerings.

029:020 And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs
        of the first year without blemish;

029:021 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:022 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:023 And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
        lambs of the first year without blemish:

029:024 Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the

029:025 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the

029:026 And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen

029:027 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the

        to their number, after the manner:

029:028 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:029 And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
        lambs of the first year without blemish:

029:030 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:031 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:032 And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen

029:033 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the

        offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:035 On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do

029:036 But ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire,
        of a sweet savour unto the LORD: one bullock, one ram, seven
        lambs of the first year without blemish:

029:037 Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock,
        for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their
        number, after the manner:

029:038 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:039 These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts,
        beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt
        offerings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink
        offerings, and for your peace offerings.

029:040 And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that
        the LORD commanded Moses.

030:001 And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the
        children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD
        hath commanded.

030:002 If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his
        soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do
        according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.

030:003 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a
        bond, being in her father's house in her youth;

030:004 And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath
        bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her;
        then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she
        hath bound her soul shall stand.

030:005 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not
        any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her
        soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her
        father disallowed her.

030:006 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered
        ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;

030:007 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day
        that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds
        wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

030:008 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it;
        then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she
        uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none
        effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.

030:009 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced,
        wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against
        her.

030:010 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by
        a bond with an oath;

030:011 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and
        disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every
        bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

030:012 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he
        heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips
        concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall
        not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall
        forgive her.

030:013 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her
        husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

030:014 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day
        to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds,
        which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his
        peace at her in the day that he heard them.

030:015 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath
        heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.

030:016 These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses,
        between a man and his wife, between the father and his
        daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.

031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

031:002 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward
        shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.

031:003 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of
        yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the
        Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.
031:004 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of
        Israel, shall ye send to the war.

031:005 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a
        thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

031:006 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe,
        them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war,
        with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his
        hand.

031:007 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded
        Moses; and they slew all the males.

031:008 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them
        that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and
        Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they
        slew with the sword.

031:009 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian
        captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all
        their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.

031:010 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all
        their goodly castles, with fire.

031:011 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and
        of beasts.

031:012 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil,
        unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation
        of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of
        Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.

031:013 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the
        congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.

031:014 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the
        captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which
        came from the battle.

031:015 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?

031:016 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the
        counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the
        matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation
        of the LORD.

031:017 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill
        every woman that hath known man by lying with him.

031:018 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying
        with him, keep alive for yourselves.

031:019 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath
        killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain,
        purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and
        on the seventh day.

031:020 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins,
        and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.

031:021 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to
        the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD
        commanded Moses;

031:022 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin,
        and the lead,

031:023 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go
        through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall
        be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth
        not the fire ye shall make go through the water.

031:024 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye
        shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.

031:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

031:026 Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of
        beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of
        the congregation:

031:027 And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the
        war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the
        congregation:

031:028 And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went
        out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons,
        and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:

031:029 Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest,
        for an heave offering of the LORD.

031:030 And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one
        portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses,
        and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto
        the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
        LORD.

031:031 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

031:032 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war
        had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and
        five thousand sheep,

031:033 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,

031:034 And threescore and one thousand asses,

031:035 And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had
        not known man by lying with him.

031:036 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to
        war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty
        thousand and five hundred sheep:

031:037 And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and
        threescore and fifteen.

031:038 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the
        LORD's tribute was threescore and twelve.

031:039 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which
        the LORD's tribute was threescore and one.

031:040 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's
        tribute was thirty and two persons.

031:041 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave
        offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

031:042 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from
        the men that warred,

031:043 (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three
        hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and
        five hundred sheep,

031:044 And thirty and six thousand beeves,

031:045 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,

031:046 And sixteen thousand persons;)

031:047 Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion
        of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the
        Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD;
        as the LORD commanded Moses.

031:048 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the
        captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near
        unto Moses:

031:049 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of
        the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh
        not one man of us.

031:050 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every
        man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets,
        rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our
        souls before the LORD.

031:051 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even
        all wrought jewels.

031:052 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the
        LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of
        hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty
        shekels.

031:053 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)

031:054 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains
        of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the
        tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the
        children of Israel before the LORD.

032:001 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very
        great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of
        Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a
        place for cattle;

032:002 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake
        unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of
        the congregation, saying,

032:003 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and
        Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

032:004 Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation
        of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:

032:005 Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let
        this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and
        bring us not over Jordan.

032:006 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of
        Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?

032:007 And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of
        Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given
        them?

032:008 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to
        see the land.

032:009 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the
        land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel,
        that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given
        them.

032:010 And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
        saying,

032:011 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty
        years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto
        Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not
        wholly followed me:

032:012 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the
        son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.

032:013 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
        them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the
        generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was
        consumed.

032:014 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an
        increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the
        LORD toward Israel.

032:015 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave
        them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.

032:016 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build
        sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little
        ones:

032:017 But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of
        Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our
        little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the
        inhabitants of the land.

032:018 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of
        Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.

032:019 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or
        forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side
        Jordan eastward.

032:020 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will
        go armed before the LORD to war,

032:021 And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD,
        until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,

032:022 And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye
        shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before
        Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the
        LORD.

032:023 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the
        LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.

032:024 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your
        sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.

032:025 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto
        Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.

032:026 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,
        shall be there in the cities of Gilead:

032:027 But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war,
        before the Lord to battle, as my lord saith.

032:028 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and
        Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of
        the children of Israel:

032:029 And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the
        children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man
        armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be
        subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead
        for a possession:

032:030 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
        possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

032:031 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,
        saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we
        do.

032:032 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of
        Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side
        Jordan may be our's.

032:033 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to
        the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh
        the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,
        and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the
        cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country
        round about.

032:034 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

032:035 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,

032:036 And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for
        sheep.

032:037 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and
        Kirjathaim,

032:038 And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and
        Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they
        builded.

032:039 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,
        and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.

032:040 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he
        dwelt therein.

032:041 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns
        thereof, and called them Havothjair.

032:042 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and
        called it Nobah, after his own name.

033:001 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went
        forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the
        hand of Moses and Aaron.

033:002 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys
        by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys
        according to their goings out.

033:003 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the
        fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the
        passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in
        the sight of all the Egyptians.

033:004 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD
        had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed
        judgments.

033:005 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched
        in Succoth.

033:006 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is
        in the edge of the wilderness.

033:007 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth,
        which is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.

033:008 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through
        the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days'
        journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.

033:009 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim
        were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm
        trees; and they pitched there.

033:010 And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.

033:011 And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the
        wilderness of Sin.

033:012 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and
        encamped in Dophkah.

033:013 And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.

033:014 And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where
        was no water for the people to drink.

033:015 And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness
        of Sinai.

033:016 And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at
        Kibrothhattaavah.

033:017 And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped at
        Hazeroth.

033:018 And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.

033:019 And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.

033:020 And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah.

033:021 And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.

033:022 And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.

033:023 And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.

033:024 And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.

033:025 And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.

033:026 And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.

033:027 And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.

033:028 And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.

033:029 And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.

033:030 And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.

033:031 And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.

033:032 And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.

033:033 And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.

033:034 And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.

033:035 And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.

033:036 And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the
        wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.

033:037 And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the
        edge of the land of Edom.

033:038 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment
        of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the
        children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the
        first day of the fifth month.

033:039 And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when
        he died in mount Hor.

033:040 And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the
        land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

033:041 And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.

033:042 And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.

033:043 And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.

033:044 And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the
        border of Moab.

033:045 And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.

033:046 And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in
        Almondiblathaim.

033:047 And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the
        mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.

033:048 And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in
        the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

033:049 And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto
        Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.

033:050 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
        near Jericho, saying,

033:051 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

033:052 Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from
        before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all
        their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high
        places:

033:053 And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell
        therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.

033:054 And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among
        your families: and to the more ye shall give the more
        inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less
        inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place
        where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers
        ye shall inherit.

033:055 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from
        before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye
        let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in
        your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

033:056 Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I
        thought to do unto them.

034:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

034:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall
        fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with
        the coasts thereof:)

034:003 Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin
        along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the
        outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:

034:004 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of
        Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof
        shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to
        Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:

034:005 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river
        of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.

034:006 And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great
        sea for a border: this shall be your west border.

034:007 And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye
        shall point out for you mount Hor:

034:008 From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the
        entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall
        be to Zedad:

034:009 And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of
        it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.

034:010 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to
        Shepham:

034:011 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the
        east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall
        reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:

034:012 And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of
        it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the
        coasts thereof round about.

034:013 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is
        the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD
        commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:

034:014 For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house
        of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad
        according to the house of their fathers, have received their
        inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received
        their inheritance:

034:015 The two tribes and the half tribe have received their
        inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward
        the sunrising.

034:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

034:017 These are the names of the men which shall divide the land
        unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

034:018 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the
        land by inheritance.

034:019 And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah,
        Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

034:020 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of
        Ammihud.

034:021 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

034:022 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the
        son of Jogli.

034:023 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the
        children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

034:024 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel
        the son of Shiphtan.

034:025 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun,
        Elizaphan the son of Parnach.

034:026 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar,
        Paltiel the son of Azzan.

034:027 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud
        the son of Shelomi.

034:028 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali,
        Pedahel the son of Ammihud.

034:029 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the
        inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

035:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
        near Jericho, saying,

035:002 Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the
        Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell
        in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the
        cities round about them.

035:003 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of
        them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for
        all their beasts.

035:004 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the
        Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a
        thousand cubits round about.

035:005 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side
        two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand
        cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the
        north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the
        midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.

035:006 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites
        there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint
        for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye
        shall add forty and two cities.

035:007 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be
        forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.

035:008 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession
        of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall
        give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few:
        every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according
        to his inheritance which he inheriteth.

035:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

035:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

035:011 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for
        you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any
        person at unawares.

035:012 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger;
        that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the
        congregation in judgment.

035:013 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye
        have for refuge.

035:014 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three
        cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be
        cities of refuge.

035:015 These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of
        Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among
        them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee
        thither.

035:016 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he
        die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to
        death.

035:017 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may
        die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely
        be put to death.

035:018 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he
        may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall
        surely be put to death.

035:019 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he
        meeteth him, he shall slay him.

035:020 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of
        wait, that he die;

035:021 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that
        smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer:
        the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth
        him.

035:022 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast
        upon him any thing without laying of wait,

035:023 Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not,
        and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy,
        neither sought his harm:

035:024 Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the
        revenger of blood according to these judgments:

035:025 And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand
        of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore
        him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he
        shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was
        anointed with the holy oil.

035:026 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of
        the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;

035:027 And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the
        city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer;
        he shall not be guilty of blood:

035:028 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge
        until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the
        high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his
        possession.

035:029 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you
        throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

035:030 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death
        by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify
        against any person to cause him to die.

035:031 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a
        murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put
        to death.

035:032 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the
        city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the
        land, until the death of the priest.

035:033 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it
        defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the
        blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed
        it.

035:034 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein
        I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

036:001 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of
        Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the
        families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before
        Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the
        children of Israel:

036:002 And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for
        an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord
        was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of
        Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.

036:003 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes
        of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be
        taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to
        the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so
        shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.

036:004 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then
        shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the
        tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance
        be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our
        fathers.

036:005 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the
        word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath
        said well.

036:006 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the
        daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they
        think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father
        shall they marry.

036:007 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove
        from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel
        shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his
        fathers.

036:008 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any
        tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the
        family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel
        may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.

036:009 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another
        tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel
        shall keep himself to his own inheritance.

036:010 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of
        Zelophehad:

036:011 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the
        daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's
        brothers' sons:

036:012 And they were married into the families of the sons of
        Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in
        the tribe of the family of their father.

036:013 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD
        commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in
        the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

Book 05	Deuteronomy

001:001 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this
        side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the
        Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth,
        and Dizahab.

001:002 (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount
        Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)

001:003 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh
        month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto
        the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had
        given him in commandment unto them;

001:004 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt
        in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth
        in Edrei:

001:005 On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to
        declare this law, saying,

001:006 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt
        long enough in this mount:

001:007 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the
        Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the
        plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by
        the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon,
        unto the great river, the river Euphrates.

001:008 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the
        land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
        and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.

001:009 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to
        bear you myself alone:

001:010 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are
        this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.

001:011 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so
        many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)

001:012 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden,
        and your strife?

001:013 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your
        tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.

001:014 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken
        is good for us to do.

001:015 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and
        made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and
        captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and
        captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.

001:016 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the
        causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between
        every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.

001:017 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear
        the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the
        face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is
        too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.

001:018 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye
        should do.

001:019 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that
        great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the
        mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us;
        and we came to Kadeshbarnea.

001:020 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the
        Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.

001:021 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up
        and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto
        thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.

001:022 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will
        send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and
        bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what
        cities we shall come.

001:023 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you,
        one of a tribe:

001:024 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto
        the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

001:025 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and
        brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said,
        It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.

001:026 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
        commandment of the LORD your God:

001:027 And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD
        hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,
        to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

001:028 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our
        heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the
        cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have
        seen the sons of the Anakims there.

001:029 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.

001:030 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for
        you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your
        eyes;

001:031 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD
        thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way
        that ye went, until ye came into this place.

001:032 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,

001:033 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to
        pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way
        ye should go, and in a cloud by day.

001:034 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
        sware, saying,

001:035 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil
        generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your
        fathers.

001:036 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him
        will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his
        children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.

001:037 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou
        also shalt not go in thither.

001:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he
        shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel
        to inherit it.

001:039 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and
        your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good
        and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give
        it, and they shall possess it.

001:040 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
        wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

001:041 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the
        LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD
        our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his
        weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.

001:042 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither
        fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your
        enemies.

001:043 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled
        against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously
        up into the hill.

001:044 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out
        against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in
        Seir, even unto Hormah.

001:045 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would
        not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

001:046 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that
        ye abode there.

002:001 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by
        the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we
        compassed mount Seir many days.

002:002 And the LORD spake unto me, saying,

002:003 Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you
        northward.

002:004 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through
        the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell
        in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed
        unto yourselves therefore:

002:005 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land,
        no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount
        Seir unto Esau for a possession.

002:006 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye
        shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.

002:007 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy
        hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness:
        these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou
        hast lacked nothing.

002:008 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,
        which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath,
        and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the
        wilderness of Moab.

002:009 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither
        contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their
        land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the
        children of Lot for a possession.

002:010 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and
        many, and tall, as the Anakims;

002:011 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the
        Moabites called them Emims.

002:012 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of
        Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before
        them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of
        his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.

002:013 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we
        went over the brook Zered.

002:014 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we
        were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years;
        until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out
        from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.

002:015 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy
        them from among the host, until they were consumed.

002:016 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and
        dead from among the people,

002:017 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,

002:018 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:

002:019 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
        distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give
        thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession;
        because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a
        possession.

002:020 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt
        therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;

002:021 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the
        LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and
        dwelt in their stead:

002:022 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when
        he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded
        them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:

002:023 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the
        Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them,
        and dwelt in their stead.)

002:024 Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:
        behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king
        of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend
        with him in battle.

002:025 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
        thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who
        shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in
        anguish because of thee.

002:026 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
        Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,

002:027 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way,
        I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.

002:028 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me
        water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on
        my feet;

002:029 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
        which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over
        Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.

002:030 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for
        the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart
        obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as
        appeareth this day.

002:031 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon
        and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest
        inherit his land.

002:032 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to
        fight at Jahaz.

002:033 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote
        him, and his sons, and all his people.

002:034 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
        the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we
        left none to remain:

002:035 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the
        spoil of the cities which we took.

002:036 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and
        from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there
        was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered
        all unto us:

002:037 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not,
        nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in
        the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

003:001 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king
        of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to
        battle at Edrei.

003:002 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver
        him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou
        shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
        Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

003:003 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king
        of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was
        left to him remaining.

003:004 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city
        which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region
        of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

003:005 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;
        beside unwalled towns a great many.

003:006 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of
        Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of
        every city.

003:007 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a
        prey to ourselves.

003:008 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of
        the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the
        river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;

003:009 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call
        it Shenir;)

003:010 All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,
        unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

003:011 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
        behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in
        Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length
        thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of
        a man.

003:012 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer,
        which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the
        cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

003:013 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of
        Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of
        Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.

003:014 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto
        the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his
        own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.

003:015 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

003:016 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from
        Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the
        border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the
        children of Ammon;

003:017 The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from
        Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea,
        under Ashdothpisgah eastward.

003:018 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God
        hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over
        armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that
        are meet for the war.

003:019 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I
        know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities
        which I have given you;

003:020 Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as
        unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD
        your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye
        return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.

003:021 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have
        seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two
        kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou
        passest.

003:022 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight
        for you.

003:023 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,

003:024 O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness,
        and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in
        earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to
        thy might?

003:025 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is
        beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

003:026 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not
        hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak
        no more unto me of this matter.

003:027 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes
        westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and
        behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this
        Jordan.

003:028 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for
        he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them
        to inherit the land which thou shalt see.

003:029 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.

004:001 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto
        the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may
        live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of
        your fathers giveth you.

004:002 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither
        shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the
        commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

004:003 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for
        all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath
        destroyed them from among you.

004:004 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every
        one of you this day.

004:005 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the
        LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land
        whither ye go to possess it.

004:006 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
        understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear
        all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a
        wise and understanding people.

004:007 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto
        them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon
        him for?

004:008 And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and
        judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you
        this day?

004:009 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest
        thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest
        they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach
        them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;

004:010 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God
        in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people
        together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may
        learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the
        earth, and that they may teach their children.

004:011 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the
        mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with
        darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.

004:012 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye
        heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye
        heard a voice.

004:013 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you
        to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two
        tables of stone.

004:014 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes
        and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go
        over to possess it.

004:015 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no
        manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you
        in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:

004:016 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the
        similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

004:017 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness
        of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,

004:018 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the
        likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:

004:019 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou
        seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host
        of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve
        them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations
        under the whole heaven.

004:020 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the
        iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of
        inheritance, as ye are this day.

004:021 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and
        sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not
        go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
        for an inheritance:

004:022 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye
        shall go over, and possess that good land.

004:023 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the
        LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven
        image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God
        hath forbidden thee.

004:024 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.

004:025 When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and
        ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt
        yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any
        thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to
        provoke him to anger:

004:026 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that
        ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go
        over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon
        it, but shall utterly be destroyed.

004:027 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall
        be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD
        shall lead you.

004:028 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood
        and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

004:029 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou
        shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with
        all thy soul.

004:030 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come
        upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD
        thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;

004:031 (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake
        thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy
        fathers which he sware unto them.

004:032 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,
        since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask
        from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath
        been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard
        like it?

004:033 Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the
        midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?

004:034 Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst
        of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders,
        and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm,
        and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God
        did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

004:035 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD
        he is God; there is none else beside him.

004:036 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might
        instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire;
        and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.

004:037 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their
        seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his
        mighty power out of Egypt;

004:038 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier
        than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for
        an inheritance, as it is this day.

004:039 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that
        the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth
        beneath: there is none else.

004:040 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,
        which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee,
        and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong
        thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee,
        for ever.

004:041 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the
        sunrising;

004:042 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his
        neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that
        fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:

004:043 Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the
        Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in
        Bashan, of the Manassites.

004:044 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of
        Israel:

004:045 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the
        judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
        after they came forth out of Egypt.

004:046 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in
        the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon,
        whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were
        come forth out of Egypt:

004:047 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of
        Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side
        Jordan toward the sunrising;

004:048 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto
        mount Sion, which is Hermon,

004:049 And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the
        sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

005:001 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O
        Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears
        this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.

005:002 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

005:003 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
        even us, who are all of us here alive this day.

005:004 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the
        midst of the fire,

005:005 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you
        the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the
        fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,

005:006 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
        Egypt, from the house of bondage.

005:007 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

005:008 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of
        any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
        beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:

005:009 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for
        I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
        the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
        generation of them that hate me,

005:010 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep
        my commandments.

005:011 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for
        the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
        vain.

005:012 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath
        commanded thee.

005:013 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:

005:014 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it
        thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
        daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine
        ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger
        that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy
        maidservant may rest as well as thou.

005:015 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,
        and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a
        mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy
        God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.

005:016 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath
        commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it
        may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God
        giveth thee.

005:017 Thou shalt not kill.

005:018 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.

005:019 Neither shalt thou steal.

005:020 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.

005:021 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt
        thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his
        manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any
        thing that is thy neighbour's.

005:022 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount
        out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick
        darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he
        wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.

005:023 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst
        of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that
        ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and
        your elders;

005:024 And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory
        and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the
        midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk
        with man, and he liveth.

005:025 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will
        consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more,
        then we shall die.

005:026 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of
        the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we
        have, and lived?

005:027 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say:
        and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak
        unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.

005:028 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto
        me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the
        words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they
        have well said all that they have spoken.

005:029 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear
        me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well
        with them, and with their children for ever!

005:030 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.

005:031 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto
        thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the
        judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them
        in the land which I give them to possess it.

005:032 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath
        commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to
        the left.

005:033 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath
        commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with
        you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye
        shall possess.

006:001 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the
        judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you,
        that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:

006:002 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his
        statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and
        thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that
        thy days may be prolonged.

006:003 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be
        well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD
        God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that
        floweth with milk and honey.

006:004 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:

006:005 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and
        with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

006:006 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in
        thine heart:

006:007 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and
        shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
        thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when
        thou risest up.

006:008 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they
        shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.

006:009 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on
        thy gates.

006:010 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee
        into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to
        Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities,
        which thou buildedst not,

006:011 And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not,
        and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive
        trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten
        and be full;

006:012 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee
        forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

006:013 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt
        swear by his name.

006:014 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people
        which are round about you;

006:015 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the
        anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy
        thee from off the face of the earth.

006:016 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in
        Massah.

006:017 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your
        God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath
        commanded thee.

006:018 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of
        the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest
        go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy
        fathers.

006:019 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD
        hath spoken.

006:020 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What
        mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments,
        which the LORD our God hath commanded you?

006:021 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in
        Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty
        hand:

006:022 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon
        Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our
        eyes:

006:023 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in,
        to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.

006:024 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear
        the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve
        us alive, as it is at this day.

006:025 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all
        these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath
        commanded us.

007:001 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither
        thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations
        before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the
        Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the
        Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier
        than thou;

007:002 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou
        shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no
        covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:

007:003 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou
        shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take
        unto thy son.

007:004 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they
        may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled
        against you, and destroy thee suddenly.

007:005 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their
        altars, and break down their images, and cut down their
        groves, and burn their graven images with fire.

007:006 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD
        thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself,
        above all people that are upon the face of the earth.

007:007 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you,
        because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were
        the fewest of all people:

007:008 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the
        oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD
        brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of
        the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

007:009 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful
        God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him
        and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;

007:010 And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy
        them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will
        repay him to his face.

007:011 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes,
        and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.

007:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these
        judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall
        keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto
        thy fathers:

007:013 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he
        will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy
        land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of
        thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he
        sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

007:014 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be
        male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.

007:015 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will
        put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest,
        upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.

007:016 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God
        shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them:
        neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare
        unto thee.

007:017 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than
        I; how can I dispossess them?

007:018 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what
        the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;

007:019 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and
        the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm,
        whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD
        thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.

007:020 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them,
        until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be
        destroyed.

007:021 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is
        among you, a mighty God and terrible.

007:022 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by
        little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest
        the beasts of the field increase upon thee.

007:023 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall
        destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be
        destroyed.

007:024 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou
        shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man
        be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.

007:025 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou
        shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take
        it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an
        abomination to the LORD thy God.

007:026 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest
        thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest
        it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

008:001 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye
        observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and
        possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.

008:002 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led
        thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and
        to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou
        wouldest keep his commandments, or no.

008:003 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee
        with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers
        know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by
        bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth
        of the LORD doth man live.

008:004 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot
        swell, these forty years.

008:005 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man
        chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.

008:006 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy
        God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.

008:007 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of
        brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of
        valleys and hills;

008:008 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and
        pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;

008:009 A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou
        shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron,
        and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.

008:010 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the
        LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.

008:011 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping
        his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I
        command thee this day:

008:012 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly
        houses, and dwelt therein;

008:013 And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and
        thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;

008:014 Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy
        God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from
        the house of bondage;

008:015 Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness,
        wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where
        there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the
        rock of flint;

008:016 Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers
        knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove
        thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;

008:017 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine
        hand hath gotten me this wealth.

008:018 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that
        giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his
        covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

008:019 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God,
        and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I
        testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.

008:020 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so
        shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the
        voice of the LORD your God.

009:001 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go
        in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself,
        cities great and fenced up to heaven,

009:002 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom
        thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand
        before the children of Anak!

009:003 Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he
        which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall
        destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so
        shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the
        LORD hath said unto thee.

009:004 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God
        hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my
        righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this
        land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth
        drive them out from before thee.

009:005 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine
        heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the
        wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them
        out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which
        the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

009:006 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not
        this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou
        art a stiffnecked people.

009:007 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God
        to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst
        depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this
        place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.

009:008 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD
        was angry with you to have destroyed you.

009:009 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of
        stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made
        with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty
        nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:

009:010 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written
        with the finger of God; and on them was written according to
        all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out
        of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

009:011 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
        that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables
        of the covenant.

009:012 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from
        hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of
        Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside
        out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a
        molten image.

009:013 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this
        people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

009:014 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name
        from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier
        and greater than they.

009:015 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned
        with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two
        hands.

009:016 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your
        God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside
        quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.

009:017 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands,
        and brake them before your eyes.

009:018 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days
        and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water,
        because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in
        the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

009:019 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith
        the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD
        hearkened unto me at that time also.

009:020 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him:
        and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.

009:021 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it
        with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even
        until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof
        into the brook that descended out of the mount.

009:022 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye
        provoked the LORD to wrath.

009:023 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go
        up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye
        rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye
        believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.

009:024 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I
        knew you.

009:025 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights,
        as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he
        would destroy you.

009:026 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD,
        destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast
        redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth
        out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

009:027 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not
        unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness,
        nor to their sin:

009:028 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the
        LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he
        promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them
        out to slay them in the wilderness.

009:029 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou
        broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out
        arm.

010:001 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of
        stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount,
        and make thee an ark of wood.

010:002 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the
        first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in
        the ark.

010:003 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of
        stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having
        the two tables in mine hand.

010:004 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
        the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the
        mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly:
        and the LORD gave them unto me.

010:005 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the
        tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the
        LORD commanded me.

010:006 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of
        the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there
        he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's
        office in his stead.

010:007 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to
        Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

010:008 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the
        ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to
        minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

010:009 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;
        the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God
        promised him.

010:010 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty
        days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that
        time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.

010:011 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the
        people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I
        sware unto their fathers to give unto them.

010:012 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee,
        but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to
        love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and
        with all thy soul,

010:013 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which
        I command thee this day for thy good?

010:014 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy
        God, the earth also, with all that therein is.

010:015 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and
        he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as
        it is this day.

010:016 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no
        more stiffnecked.

010:017 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a
        great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not
        persons, nor taketh reward:

010:018 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and
        loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

010:019 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the
        land of Egypt.

010:020 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to
        him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.

010:021 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee
        these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

010:022 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten
        persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars
        of heaven for multitude.

011:001 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his
        charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his
        commandments, alway.

011:002 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which
        have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of
        the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his
        stretched out arm,

011:003 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of
        Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

011:004 And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and
        to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to
        overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath
        destroyed them unto this day;

011:005 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into
        this place;

011:006 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the
        son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed
        them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the
        substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all
        Israel:

011:007 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which
        he did.

011:008 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command
        you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the
        land, whither ye go to possess it;

011:009 And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD
        sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a
        land that floweth with milk and honey.

011:010 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as
        the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst
        thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of
        herbs:

011:011 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills
        and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:

011:012 A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD
        thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year
        even unto the end of the year.

011:013 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto
        my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD
        your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all
        your soul,

011:014 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,
        the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in
        thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.

011:015 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou
        mayest eat and be full.

011:016 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and
        ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

011:017 And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut
        up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield
        not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good
        land which the LORD giveth you.

011:018 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in
        your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they
        may be as frontlets between your eyes.

011:019 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when
        thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way,
        when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

011:020 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,
        and upon thy gates:

011:021 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your
        children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers
        to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

011:022 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I
        command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in
        all his ways, and to cleave unto him;

011:023 Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before
        you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than
        yourselves.

011:024 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall
        be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the
        river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast
        be.

011:025 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD
        your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon
        all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto
        you.

011:026 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

011:027 A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God,
        which I command you this day:

011:028 And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD
        your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you
        this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.

011:029 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought
        thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that
        thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse
        upon mount Ebal.

011:030 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the
        sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in
        the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

011:031 For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land
        which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it,
        and dwell therein.

011:032 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments
        which I set before you this day.

012:001 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe
        to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth
        thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.

012:002 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations
        which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high
        mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:

012:003 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars,
        and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the
        graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out
        of that place.

012:004 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.

012:005 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of
        all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his
        habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:

012:006 And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your
        sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand,
        and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings
        of your herds and of your flocks:

012:007 And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall
        rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your
        households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.

012:008 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,
        every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.

012:009 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
        which the LORD your God giveth you.

012:010 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the
        LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you
        rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in
        safety;

012:011 Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall
        choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye
        bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your
        sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand,
        and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:

012:012 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your
        sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your
        maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates;
        forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.

012:013 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings
        in every place that thou seest:

012:014 But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy
        tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there
        thou shalt do all that I command thee.

012:015 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy
        gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the
        blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the
        unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and
        as of the hart.

012:016 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the
        earth as water.

012:017 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or
        of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or
        of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy
        freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:

012:018 But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place
        which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and
        thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
        Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before
        the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.

012:019 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long
        as thou livest upon the earth.

012:020 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath
        promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because
        thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh,
        whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

012:021 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his
        name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy
        herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I
        have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates
        whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

012:022 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat
        them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.

012:023 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the
        life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.

012:024 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as
        water.

012:025 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with
        thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is
        right in the sight of the LORD.

012:026 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt
        take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:

012:027 And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the
        blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of
        thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD
        thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.

012:028 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it
        may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for
        ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the
        sight of the LORD thy God.

012:029 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before
        thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest
        them, and dwellest in their land;

012:030 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following
        them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that
        thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these
        nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.

012:031 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every
        abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto
        their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have
        burnt in the fire to their gods.

012:032 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt
        not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

013:001 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,
        and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,

013:002 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto
        thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not
        known, and let us serve them;

013:003 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that
        dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know
        whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with
        all your soul.

013:004 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep
        his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him,
        and cleave unto him.

013:005 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to
        death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD
        your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and
        redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out
        of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in.
        So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.

013:006 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy
        daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as
        thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and
        serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy
        fathers;

013:007 Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you,
        nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the
        earth even unto the other end of the earth;

013:008 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither
        shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither
        shalt thou conceal him:

013:009 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon
        him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the
        people.

013:010 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he
        hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which
        brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
        bondage.

013:011 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any
        such wickedness as this is among you.

013:012 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD
        thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,

013:013 Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among
        you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying,
        Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;

013:014 Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently;
        and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such
        abomination is wrought among you;

013:015 Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the
        edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is
        therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.

013:016 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of
        the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all
        the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it
        shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.

013:017 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine
        hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger,
        and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and
        multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;

013:018 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to
        keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do
        that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.

014:001 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut
        yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the
        dead.

014:002 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the
        LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself,
        above all the nations that are upon the earth.

014:003 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.

014:004 These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep,
        and the goat,

014:005 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild
        goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.

014:006 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft
        into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye
        shall eat.

014:007 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud,
        or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the
        hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the
        hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.

014:008 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not
        the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their
        flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.

014:009 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that
        have fins and scales shall ye eat:

014:010 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is
        unclean unto you.

014:011 Of all clean birds ye shall eat.

014:012 But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and
        the ossifrage, and the ospray,

014:013 And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,

014:014 And every raven after his kind,

014:015 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk
        after his kind,

014:016 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,

014:017 And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,

014:018 And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing,
        and the bat.

014:019 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they
        shall not be eaten.

014:020 But of all clean fowls ye may eat.

014:021 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt
        give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may
        eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an
        holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid
        in his mother's milk.

014:022 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the
        field bringeth forth year by year.

014:023 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which
        he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy
        corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy
        herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the
        LORD thy God always.

014:024 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able
        to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the
        LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD
        thy God hath blessed thee:

014:025 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in
        thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God
        shall choose:

014:026 And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul
        lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for
        strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou
        shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt
        rejoice, thou, and thine household,

014:027 And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not
        forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.

014:028 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe
        of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within
        thy gates:

014:029 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with
        thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow,
        which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be
        satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the
        work of thine hand which thou doest.

015:001 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.

015:002 And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that
        lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall
        not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it
        is called the LORD's release.

015:003 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is
        thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;

015:004 Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall
        greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee for an inheritance to possess it:

015:005 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy
        God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command
        thee this day.

015:006 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and
        thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow;
        and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not
        reign over thee.

015:007 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within
        any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand
        from thy poor brother:

015:008 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely
        lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.

015:009 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,
        saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and
        thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest
        him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be
        sin unto thee.

015:010 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be
        grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing
        the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all
        that thou puttest thine hand unto.

015:011 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I
        command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy
        brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.

015:012 And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold
        unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year
        thou shalt let him go free from thee.

015:013 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not
        let him go away empty:

015:014 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of
        thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the
        LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.

015:015 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
        of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I
        command thee this thing to day.

015:016 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from
        thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is
        well with thee;

015:017 Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear
        unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also
        unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.

015:018 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away
        free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant
        to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall
        bless thee in all that thou doest.

015:019 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock
        thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no
        work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the
        firstling of thy sheep.

015:020 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the
        place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.

015:021 And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or
        blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it
        unto the LORD thy God.

015:022 Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean
        person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.

015:023 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it
        upon the ground as water.

016:001 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD
        thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought
        thee forth out of Egypt by night.

016:002 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy
        God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD
        shall choose to place his name there.

016:003 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt
        thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of
        affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in
        haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest
        forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.

016:004 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy
        coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh,
        which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all
        night until the morning.

016:005 Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy
        gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:

016:006 But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place
        his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even,
        at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest
        forth out of Egypt.

016:007 And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD
        thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and
        go unto thy tents.

016:008 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh
        day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt
        do no work therein.

016:009 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the
        seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle
        to the corn.

016:010 And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God
        with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which
        thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD
        thy God hath blessed thee:

016:011 And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy
        son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy
        maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the
        stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among
        you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place
        his name there.

016:012 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and
        thou shalt observe and do these statutes.

016:013 Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after
        that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:

016:014 And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and
        thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
        Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that
        are within thy gates.

016:015 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy
        God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD
        thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the
        works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

016:016 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the
        LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast
        of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the
        feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the
        LORD empty:

016:017 Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing
        of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.

016:018 Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates,
        which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and
        they shall judge the people with just judgment.

016:019 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons,
        neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the
        wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.

016:020 That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou
        mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God
        giveth thee.

016:021 Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the
        altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.

016:022 Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy
        God hateth.

017:001 Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or
        sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that
        is an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

017:002 If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the
        LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought
        wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing
        his covenant,

017:003 And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them,
        either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I
        have not commanded;

017:004 And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired
        diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain,
        that such abomination is wrought in Israel:

017:005 Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have
        committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or
        that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.

017:006 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he
        that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of
        one witness he shall not be put to death.

017:007 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him
        to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou
        shalt put the evil away from among you.

017:008 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between
        blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and
        stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then
        shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the
        LORD thy God shall choose;

017:009 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the
        judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall
        shew thee the sentence of judgment:

017:010 And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of
        that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and
        thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform
        thee:

017:011 According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach
        thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell
        thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence
        which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the
        left.

017:012 And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken
        unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the
        LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and
        thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.

017:013 And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more
        presumptuously.

017:014 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt
        say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that
        are about me;

017:015 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD
        thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou
        set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee,
        which is not thy brother.

017:016 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the
        people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply
        horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall
        henceforth return no more that way.

017:017 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart
        turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself
        silver and gold.

017:018 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his
        kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book
        out of that which is before the priests the Levites:

017:019 And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the
        days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God,
        to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do
        them:

017:020 That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that
        he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or
        to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his
        kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.

018:001 The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have
        no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the
        offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.

018:002 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren:
        the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.

018:003 And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them
        that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they
        shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks,
        and the maw.

018:004 The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine
        oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give
        him.

018:005 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to
        stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons
        for ever.

018:006 And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel,
        where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind
        unto the place which the LORD shall choose;

018:007 Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all
        his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the
        LORD.

018:008 They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh
        of the sale of his patrimony.

018:009 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of
        those nations.

018:010 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son
        or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth
        divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a
        witch.

018:011 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a
        wizard, or a necromancer.

018:012 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD:
        and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive
        them out from before thee.

018:013 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.

018:014 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto
        observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the
        LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.

018:015 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the
        midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye
        shall hearken;

018:016 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in
        Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear
        again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this
        great fire any more, that I die not.

018:017 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which
        they have spoken.

018:018 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like
        unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall
        speak unto them all that I shall command him.

018:019 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken
        unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require
        it of him.

018:020 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my
        name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall
        speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.

018:021 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word
        which the LORD hath not spoken?

018:022 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing
        follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD
        hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it
        presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

019:001 When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the
        LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and
        dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;

019:002 Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy
        land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.

019:003 Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy
        land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into
        three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.

019:004 And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither,
        that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom
        he hated not in time past;

019:005 As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew
        wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down
        the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth
        upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of
        those cities, and live:

019:006 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his
        heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and
        slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he
        hated him not in time past.

019:007 Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three
        cities for thee.

019:008 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn
        unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised
        to give unto thy fathers;

019:009 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I
        command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk
        ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for
        thee, beside these three:

019:010 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD
        thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon
        thee.

019:011 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him,
        and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die,
        and fleeth into one of these cities:

019:012 Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence,
        and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he
        may die.

019:013 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the
        guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with
        thee.

019:014 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of
        old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt
        inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to
        possess it.

019:015 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity,
        or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of
        two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the
        matter be established.

019:016 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against
        him that which is wrong;

019:017 Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall
        stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges,
        which shall be in those days;

019:018 And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold,
        if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely
        against his brother;

019:019 Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto
        his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.

019:020 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall
        henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.

019:021 And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye
        for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

020:001 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest
        horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not
        afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which
        brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

020:002 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that
        the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,

020:003 And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day
        unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint,
        fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because
        of them;

020:004 For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for
        you against your enemies, to save you.

020:005 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man
        is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated
        it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the
        battle, and another man dedicate it.

020:006 And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not
        yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house,
        lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.

020:007 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not
        taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die
        in the battle, and another man take her.

020:008 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they
        shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted?
        let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's
        heart faint as well as his heart.

020:009 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of
        speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the
        armies to lead the people.

020:010 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then
        proclaim peace unto it.

020:011 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open
        unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found
        therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve
        thee.

020:012 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war
        against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:

020:013 And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands,
        thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the
        sword:

020:014 But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all
        that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou
        take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine
        enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

020:015 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off
        from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.

020:016 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth
        give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing
        that breatheth:

020:017 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and
        the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites,
        and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:

020:018 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,
        which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against
        the LORD your God.

020:019 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war
        against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees
        thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of
        them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the
        field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:

020:020 Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for
        meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt
        build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee,
        until it be subdued.

021:001 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God
        giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not
        known who hath slain him:

021:002 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they
        shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that
        is slain:

021:003 And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain
        man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which
        hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the
        yoke;

021:004 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a
        rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall
        strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:

021:005 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the
        LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in
        the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every
        controversy and every stroke be tried:

021:006 And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain
        man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded
        in the valley:

021:007 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this
        blood, neither have our eyes seen it.

021:008 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast
        redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of
        Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.

021:009 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among
        you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of
        the LORD.

021:010 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the
        LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou
        hast taken them captive,

021:011 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a
        desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;

021:012 Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall
        shave her head, and pare her nails;

021:013 And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her,
        and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her
        mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her,
        and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.

021:014 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou
        shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her
        at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her,
        because thou hast humbled her.

021:015 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and
        they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated;
        and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:

021:016 Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that
        which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved
        firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the
        firstborn:

021:017 But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the
        firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath:
        for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the
        firstborn is his.

021:018 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not
        obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and
        that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto
        them:

021:019 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and
        bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate
        of his place;

021:020 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son
        is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is
        a glutton, and a drunkard.

021:021 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that
        he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all
        Israel shall hear, and fear.

021:022 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be
        to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:

021:023 His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou
        shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is
        accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD
        thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

022:001 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray,
        and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them
        again unto thy brother.

022:002 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him
        not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it
        shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou
        shalt restore it to him again.

022:003 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou
        do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's,
        which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do
        likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.

022:004 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by
        the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help
        him to lift them up again.

022:005 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,
        neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do
        so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

022:006 If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any
        tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs,
        and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou
        shalt not take the dam with the young:

022:007 But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young
        to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest
        prolong thy days.

022:008 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a
        battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine
        house, if any man fall from thence.

022:009 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the
        fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy
        vineyard, be defiled.

022:010 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

022:011 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen
        and linen together.

022:012 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy
        vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.

022:013 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,

022:014 And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil
        name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to
        her, I found her not a maid:

022:015 Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and
        bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the
        elders of the city in the gate:

022:016 And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my
        daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;

022:017 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her,
        saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the
        tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the
        cloth before the elders of the city.

022:018 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise
        him;

022:019 And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and
        give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath
        brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall
        be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.

022:020 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not
        found for the damsel:

022:021 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her
        father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with
        stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel,
        to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put
        evil away from among you.

022:022 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband,
        then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with
        the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from
        Israel.

022:023 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and
        a man find her in the city, and lie with her;

022:024 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city,
        and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel,
        because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because
        he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away
        evil from among you.

022:025 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man
        force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with
        her shall die.

022:026 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the
        damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth
        against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this
        matter:

022:027 For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried,
        and there was none to save her.

022:028 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not
        betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be
        found;

022:029 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's
        father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife;
        because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his
        days.

022:030 A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his
        father's skirt.

023:001 He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut
        off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

023:002 A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD;
        even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the
        congregation of the LORD.

023:003 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation
        of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not
        enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:

023:004 Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way,
        when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired
        against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia,
        to curse thee.

023:005 Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam;
        but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto
        thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.

023:006 Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy
        days for ever.

023:007 Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou
        shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in
        his land.

023:008 The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the
        congregation of the LORD in their third generation.

023:009 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep
        thee from every wicked thing.

023:010 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of
        uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go
        abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

023:011 But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself
        with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the
        camp again.

023:012 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou
        shalt go forth abroad:

023:013 And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be,
        when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith,
        and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:

023:014 For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to
        deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee;
        therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing
        in thee, and turn away from thee.

023:015 Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is
        escaped from his master unto thee:

023:016 He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which
        he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best:
        thou shalt not oppress him.

023:017 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a
        sodomite of the sons of Israel.

023:018 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a
        dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even
        both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

023:019 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money,
        usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:

023:020 Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy
        brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God
        may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the
        land whither thou goest to possess it.

023:021 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt
        not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require
        it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.

023:022 But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.

023:023 That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and
        perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast
        vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy
        mouth.

023:024 When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou
        mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou
        shalt not put any in thy vessel.

023:025 When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then
        thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not
        move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.

024:001 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to
        pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath
        found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill
        of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of
        his house.

024:002 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be
        another man's wife.

024:003 And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of
        divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of
        his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be
        his wife;

024:004 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her
        again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is
        abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land
        to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

024:005 When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war,
        neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be
        free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he
        hath taken.

024:006 No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge:
        for he taketh a man's life to pledge.

024:007 If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children
        of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then
        that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among
        you.

024:008 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe
        diligently, and do according to all that the priests the
        Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall
        observe to do.

024:009 Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way,
        after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.

024:010 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go
        into his house to fetch his pledge.

024:011 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend
        shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.

024:012 And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:

024:013 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the
        sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and
        bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the
        LORD thy God.

024:014 Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and
        needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that
        are in thy land within thy gates:

024:015 At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun
        go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon
        it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto
        thee.

024:016 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
        neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:
        every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

024:017 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of
        the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:

024:018 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and
        the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command
        thee to do this thing.

024:019 When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast
        forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch
        it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for
        the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the
        work of thine hands.

024:020 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the
        boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the
        fatherless, and for the widow.

024:021 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not
        glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the
        fatherless, and for the widow.

024:022 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
        of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

025:001 If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto
        judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall
        justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.

025:002 And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten,
        that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten
        before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.

025:003 Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he
        should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes,
        then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.

025:004 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.

025:005 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no
        child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a
        stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take
        her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's
        brother unto her.

025:006 And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall
        succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his
        name be not put out of Israel.

025:007 And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let
        his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say,
        My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a
        name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's
        brother.

025:008 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto
        him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;

025:009 Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of
        the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in
        his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto
        that man that will not build up his brother's house.

025:010 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that
        hath his shoe loosed.

025:011 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the
        one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of
        him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh
        him by the secrets:

025:012 Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity
        her.

025:013 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a
        small.

025:014 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great
        and a small.

025:015 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and
        just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened
        in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

025:016 For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously,
        are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

025:017 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were
        come forth out of Egypt;

025:018 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee,
        even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint
        and weary; and he feared not God.

025:019 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee
        rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the
        LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it,
        that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under
        heaven; thou shalt not forget it.

026:001 And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the
        LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest
        it, and dwellest therein;

026:002 That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the
        earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy
        God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go
        unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place
        his name there.

026:003 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days,
        and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God,
        that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our
        fathers for to give us.

026:004 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and
        set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.

026:005 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian
        ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt,
        and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation,
        great, mighty, and populous:

026:006 And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and
        laid upon us hard bondage:

026:007 And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD
        heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour,
        and our oppression:

026:008 And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand,
        and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and
        with signs, and with wonders:

026:009 And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this
        land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.

026:010 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land,
        which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it
        before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:

026:011 And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy
        God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the
        Levite, and the stranger that is among you.

026:012 When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine
        increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and
        hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless,
        and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be
        filled;

026:013 Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought
        away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have
        given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the
        fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy
        commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not
        transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.

026:014 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken
        away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought
        thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the
        LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast
        commanded me.

026:015 Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy
        people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou
        swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and
        honey.

026:016 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these
        statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them
        with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

026:017 Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to
        walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his
        commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his
        voice:

026:018 And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar
        people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep
        all his commandments;

026:019 And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in
        praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an
        holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.

027:001 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people,
        saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this
        day.

027:002 And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto
        the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt
        set thee up great stones, and plaister them with plaister:

027:003 And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when
        thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land
        which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with
        milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised
        thee.

027:004 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye
        shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in
        mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister.

027:005 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an
        altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon
        them.

027:006 Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole
        stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the
        LORD thy God:

027:007 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and
        rejoice before the LORD thy God.

027:008 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law
        very plainly.

027:009 And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel,
        saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art
        become the people of the LORD thy God.

027:010 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and
        do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee
        this day.

027:011 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,

027:012 These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when
        ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and
        Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:

027:013 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad,
        and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

027:014 And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of
        Israel with a loud voice,

027:015 Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an
        abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the
        craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the
        people shall answer and say, Amen.

027:016 Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother.
        And all the people shall say, Amen.

027:017 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all
        the people shall say, Amen.

027:018 Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way.
        And all the people shall say, Amen.

027:019 Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger,
        fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.

027:020 Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he
        uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say,
        Amen.

027:021 Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the
        people shall say, Amen.

027:022 Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his
        father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people
        shall say, Amen.

027:023 Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the
        people shall say, Amen.

027:024 Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the
        people shall say, Amen.

027:025 Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person.
        And all the people shall say, Amen.

027:026 Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to
        do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.

028:001 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently
        unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all
        his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD
        thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:

028:002 And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee,
        if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.

028:003 Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be
        in the field.

028:004 Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
        ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine,
        and the flocks of thy sheep.

028:005 Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

028:006 Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt
        thou be when thou goest out.

028:007 The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee
        to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against
        thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways.

028:008 The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy
        storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and
        he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee.

028:009 The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as
        he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments
        of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways.

028:010 And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by
        the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.

028:011 And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit
        of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit
        of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy
        fathers to give thee.

028:012 The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to
        give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all
        the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations,
        and thou shalt not borrow.

028:013 And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and
        thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if
        that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God,
        which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:

028:014 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I
        command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to
        go after other gods to serve them.

028:015 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the
        voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his
        commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day;
        that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:

028:016 Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in
        the field.

028:017 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.

028:018 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
        land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

028:019 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt
        thou be when thou goest out.

028:020 The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke,
        in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou
        be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the
        wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.

028:021 The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he
        have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to
        possess it.

028:022 The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a
        fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning,
        and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and
        they shall pursue thee until thou perish.

028:023 And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the
        earth that is under thee shall be iron.

028:024 The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from
        heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

028:025 The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies:
        thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways
        before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the
        earth.

028:026 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and
        unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.

028:027 The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the
        emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou
        canst not be healed.

028:028 The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and
        astonishment of heart:

028:029 And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in
        darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou
        shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall
        save thee.

028:030 Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her:
        thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein:
        thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes
        thereof.

028:031 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not
        eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from
        before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep
        shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to
        rescue them.

028:032 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people,
        and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all
        the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand.

028:033 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation
        which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only
        oppressed and crushed alway:

028:034 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which
        thou shalt see.

028:035 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with
        a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot
        unto the top of thy head.

028:036 The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set
        over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers
        have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and
        stone.

028:037 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a
        byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.

028:038 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt
        gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.

028:039 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither
        drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall
        eat them.

028:040 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but
        thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive
        shall cast his fruit.

028:041 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy
        them; for they shall go into captivity.

028:042 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.

028:043 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very
        high; and thou shalt come down very low.

028:044 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he
        shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.

028:045 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall
        pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed;
        because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy
        God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he
        commanded thee:

028:046 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and
        upon thy seed for ever.

028:047 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness,
        and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;

028:048 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall
        send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,
        and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron
        upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.

028:049 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the
        end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose
        tongue thou shalt not understand;

028:050 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the
        person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:

028:051 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy
        land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee
        either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or
        flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.

028:052 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and
        fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all
        thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates
        throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given
        thee.

028:053 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of
        thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath
        given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith
        thine enemies shall distress thee:

028:054 So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate,
        his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife
        of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he
        shall leave:

028:055 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his
        children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him
        in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies
        shall distress thee in all thy gates.

028:056 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not
        adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for
        delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the
        husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her
        daughter,

028:057 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her
        feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she
        shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege
        and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in
        thy gates.

028:058 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that
        are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious
        and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;

028:059 Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues
        of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and
        sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.

028:060 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,
        which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

028:061 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in
        the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee,
        until thou be destroyed.

028:062 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the
        stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey
        the voice of the LORD thy God.

028:063 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you
        to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice
        over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye
        shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to
        possess it.

028:064 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one
        end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt
        serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have
        known, even wood and stone.

028:065 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall
        the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee
        there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of
        mind:

028:066 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt
        fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:

028:067 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at
        even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear
        of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of
        thine eyes which thou shalt see.

028:068 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by
        the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more
        again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for
        bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

029:001 These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded
        Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab,
        beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.

029:002 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have
        seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of
        Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all
        his land;

029:003 The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs,
        and those great miracles:

029:004 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes
        to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

029:005 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes
        are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon
        thy foot.

029:006 Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong
        drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.

029:007 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon,
        and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle,
        and we smote them:

029:008 And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto
        the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of
        Manasseh.

029:009 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that
        ye may prosper in all that ye do.

029:010 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your
        captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with
        all the men of Israel,

029:011 Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy
        camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:

029:012 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God,
        and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee
        this day:

029:013 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself,
        and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee,
        and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,
        and to Jacob.

029:014 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;

029:015 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the
        LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this
        day:

029:016 (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how
        we came through the nations which ye passed by;

029:017 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and
        stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)

029:018 Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or
        tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our
        God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there
        should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;

029:019 And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse,
        that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have
        peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add
        drunkenness to thirst:

029:020 The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD
        and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the
        curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and
        the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.

029:021 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the
        tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant
        that are written in this book of the law:

029:022 So that the generation to come of your children that shall
        rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far
        land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and
        the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;

029:023 And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and
        burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass
        groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah,
        Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and
        in his wrath:

029:024 Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus
        unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?

029:025 Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of
        the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he
        brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:

029:026 For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods
        whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:

029:027 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to
        bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:

029:028 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in
        wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another
        land, as it is this day.

029:029 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those
        things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children
        for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

030:001 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon
        thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before
        thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations,
        whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,

030:002 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his
        voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and
        thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;

030:003 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have
        compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all
        the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.

030:004 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of
        heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and
        from thence will he fetch thee:

030:005 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy
        fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do
        thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.

030:006 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the
        heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine
        heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.

030:007 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine
        enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.

030:008 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do
        all his commandments which I command thee this day.

030:009 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of
        thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy
        cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD
        will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy
        fathers:

030:010 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to
        keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in
        this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God
        with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

030:011 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not
        hidden from thee, neither is it far off.

030:012 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up
        for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it,
        and do it?

030:013 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
        shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we
        may hear it, and do it?

030:014 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy
        heart, that thou mayest do it.

030:015 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
        and evil;

030:016 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to
        walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his
        statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and
        multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land
        whither thou goest to possess it.

030:017 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but
        shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

030:018 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and
        that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither
        thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.

030:019 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I
        have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing:
        therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:

030:020 That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest
        obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he
        is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest
        dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to
        Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

031:001 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

031:002 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old
        this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath
        said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

031:003 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will
        destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess
        them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD
        hath said.

031:004 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,
        kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he
        destroyed.

031:005 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may
        do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have
        commanded you.

031:006 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of
        them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee;
        he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

031:007 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight
        of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must
        go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn
        unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to
        inherit it.

031:008 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be
        with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear
        not, neither be dismayed.

031:009 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests
        the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.

031:010 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven
        years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast
        of tabernacles,

031:011 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in
        the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law
        before all Israel in their hearing.

031:012 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and
        thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and
        that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe
        to do all the words of this law:

031:013 And that their children, which have not known any thing, may
        hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live
        in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

031:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that
        thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the
        tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge.
        And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the
        tabernacle of the congregation.

031:015 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a
        cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the
        tabernacle.

031:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with
        thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring
        after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go
        to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant
        which I have made with them.

031:017 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I
        will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they
        shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall
        them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils
        come upon us, because our God is not among us?

031:018 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils
        which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto
        other gods.

031:019 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the
        children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may
        be a witness for me against the children of Israel.

031:020 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
        unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they
        shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then
        will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke
        me, and break my covenant.

031:021 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
        befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a
        witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of
        their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about,
        even now, before I have brought them into the land which I
        sware.

031:022 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it
        the children of Israel.

031:023 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be
        strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the
        children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and
        I will be with thee.

031:024 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the
        words of this law in a book, until they were finished,

031:025 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the
        covenant of the LORD, saying,

031:026 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark
        of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for
        a witness against thee.

031:027 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I
        am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious
        against the LORD; and how much more after my death?

031:028 Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your
        officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call
        heaven and earth to record against them.

031:029 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt
        yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded
        you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye
        will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger
        through the work of your hands.

031:030 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel
        the words of this song, until they were ended.

032:001 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth,
        the words of my mouth.

032:002 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as
        the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the
        showers upon the grass:

032:003 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye
        greatness unto our God.

032:004 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are
        judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right
        is he.

032:005 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of
        his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.

032:006 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is
        not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made
        thee, and established thee?

032:007 Remember the days of old, consider the years of many
        generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy
        elders, and they will tell thee.

032:008 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,
        when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the
        people according to the number of the children of Israel.

032:009 For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
        inheritance.

032:010 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
        wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him
        as the apple of his eye.

032:011 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
        spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her
        wings:

032:012 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god
        with him.

032:013 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he
        might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck
        honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

032:014 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams
        of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of
        wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

032:015 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou
        art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he
        forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of
        his salvation.

032:016 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with
        abominations provoked they him to anger.

032:017 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they
        knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers
        feared not.

032:018 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
        forgotten God that formed thee.

032:019 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the
        provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.

032:020 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what
        their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation,
        children in whom is no faith.

032:021 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God;
        they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will
        move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I
        will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.

032:022 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
        lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase,
        and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.

032:023 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon
        them.

032:024 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning
        heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth
        of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

032:025 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the
        young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of
        gray hairs.

032:026 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
        remembrance of them to cease from among men:

032:027 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
        adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they
        should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all
        this.

032:028 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
        understanding in them.

032:029 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
        would consider their latter end!

032:030 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to
        flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut
        them up?

032:031 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
        being judges.

032:032 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
        Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are
        bitter:

032:033 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
        asps.

032:034 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
        treasures?

032:035 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall
        slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand,
        and the things that shall come upon them make haste.

032:036 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for
        his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and
        there is none shut up, or left.

032:037 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom
        they trusted,

032:038 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine
        of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and
        be your protection.

032:039 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I
        kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there
        any that can deliver out of my hand.

032:040 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

032:041 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on
        judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will
        reward them that hate me.

032:042 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
        devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the
        captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

032:043 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the
        blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his
        adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his
        people.

032:044 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the
        ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

032:045 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all
        Israel:

032:046 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words
        which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command
        your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.

032:047 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life:
        and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land,
        whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

032:048 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,

032:049 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which
        is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and
        behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of
        Israel for a possession:

032:050 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered
        unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and
        was gathered unto his people:

032:051 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel
        at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin;
        because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of
        Israel.

032:052 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
        thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

033:001 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God
        blessed the children of Israel before his death.

033:002 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir
        unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with
        ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law
        for them.

033:003 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and
        they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy
        words.

033:004 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the
        congregation of Jacob.

033:005 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and
        the tribes of Israel were gathered together.

033:006 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.

033:007 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD,
        the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his
        hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from
        his enemies.

033:008 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy
        holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou
        didst strive at the waters of Meribah;

033:009 Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen
        him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own
        children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy
        covenant.

033:010 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they
        shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon
        thine altar.

033:011 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;
        smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of
        them that hate him, that they rise not again.

033:012 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell
        in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day
        long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.

033:013 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for
        the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep
        that coucheth beneath,

033:014 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for
        the precious things put forth by the moon,

033:015 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the
        precious things of the lasting hills,

033:016 And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof,
        and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the
        blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the
        head of him that was separated from his brethren.

033:017 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns
        are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the
        people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten
        thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

033:018 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;
        and, Issachar, in thy tents.

033:019 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall
        offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the
        abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

033:020 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he
        dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the
        head.

033:021 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in
        a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the
        heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and
        his judgments with Israel.

033:022 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from
        Bashan.

033:023 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour,
        and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west
        and the south.

033:024 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let
        him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in
        oil.

033:025 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall
        thy strength be.

033:026 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon
        the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

033:027 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
        everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from
        before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.

033:028 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob
        shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall
        drop down dew.

033:029 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people
        saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the
        sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found
        liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.

034:001 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of
        Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And
        the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,

034:002 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and
        all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,

034:003 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the
        city of palm trees, unto Zoar.

034:004 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware
        unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give
        it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine
        eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.

034:005 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of
        Moab, according to the word of the LORD.

034:006 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over
        against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto
        this day.

034:007 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died:
        his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

034:008 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of
        Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for
        Moses were ended.

034:009 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
        for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of
        Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

034:010 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,
        whom the LORD knew face to face,

034:011 In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to
        do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
        and to all his land,

034:012 And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which
        Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.

Book 06	Joshua

001:001 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came
        to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun,
        Moses' minister, saying,

001:002 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this
        Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do
        give to them, even to the children of Israel.

001:003 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that
        have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.

001:004 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great
        river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and
        unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be
        your coast.

001:005 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the
        days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee:
        I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

001:006 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt
        thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto
        their fathers to give them.

001:007 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest
        observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant
        commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the
        left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest.

001:008 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but
        thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest
        observe to do according to all that is written therein: for
        then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt
        have good success.

001:009 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be
        not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is
        with thee whithersoever thou goest.

001:010 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

001:011 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare
        you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this
        Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God
        giveth you to possess it.

001:012 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the
        tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,

001:013 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD
        commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest,
        and hath given you this land.

001:014 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in
        the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye
        shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of
        valour, and help them;

001:015 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given
        you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your
        God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your
        possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave
        you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

001:016 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us
        we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.

001:017 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
        hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he
        was with Moses.

001:018 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and
        will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest
        him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good
        courage.

002:001 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
        secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they
        went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged
        there.

002:002 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there
        came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to
        search out the country.

002:003 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth
        the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine
        house: for they be come to search out all the country.

002:004 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus,
        There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:

002:005 And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate,
        when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went
        I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake
        them.

002:006 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid
        them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon
        the roof.

002:007 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the
        fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone
        out, they shut the gate.

002:008 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the
        roof;

002:009 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you
        the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all
        the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.

002:010 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red
        sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto
        the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side
        Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.

002:011 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
        neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because
        of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and
        in earth beneath.

002:012 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I
        have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto
        my father's house, and give me a true token:

002:013 And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my
        brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver
        our lives from death.

002:014 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not
        this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given
        us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.

002:015 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her
        house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

002:016 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
        pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until
        the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.

002:017 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine
        oath which thou hast made us swear.

002:018 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line
        of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down
        by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy
        brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.

002:019 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of
        thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head,
        and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in
        the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon
        him.

002:020 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of
        thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.

002:021 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she
        sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet
        line in the window.

002:022 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there
        three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers
        sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.

002:023 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
        passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him
        all things that befell them:

002:024 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into
        our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the
        country do faint because of us.

003:001 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
        Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of
        Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.

003:002 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
        through the host;

003:003 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of
        the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites
        bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after
        it.

003:004 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two
        thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may
        know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this
        way heretofore.

003:005 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to
        morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.

003:006 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of
        the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took
        up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.

003:007 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to
        magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know
        that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.

003:008 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
        covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water
        of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.

003:009 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and
        hear the words of the LORD your God.

003:010 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is
        among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before
        you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the
        Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the
        Jebusites.

003:011 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth
        passeth over before you into Jordan.

003:012 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
        out of every tribe a man.

003:013 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of
        the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the
        earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of
        Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from
        above; and they shall stand upon an heap.

003:014 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents,
        to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the
        covenant before the people;

003:015 And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the
        feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim
        of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the
        time of harvest,)

003:016 That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up
        upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside
        Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,
        even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people
        passed over right against Jericho.

003:017 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the
        Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people
        were passed clean over Jordan.

004:001 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
        over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

004:002 Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a
        man,

004:003 And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst
        of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood
        firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you,
        and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this
        night.

004:004 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
        children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:

004:005 And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the
        LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every
        man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the
        number of the tribes of the children of Israel:

004:006 That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask
        their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these
        stones?

004:007 Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut
        off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed
        over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these
        stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for
        ever.

004:008 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and
        took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD
        spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of
        the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto
        the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.

004:009 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the
        place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the
        covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.

004:010 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of
        Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded
        Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses
        commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.

004:011 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
        over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests,
        in the presence of the people.

004:012 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half
        the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children
        of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:

004:013 About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the
        LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

004:014 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all
        Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the
        days of his life.

004:015 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

004:016 Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that
        they come up out of Jordan.

004:017 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out
        of Jordan.

004:018 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
        covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan,
        and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry
        land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and
        flowed over all his banks, as they did before.

004:019 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the
        first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of
        Jericho.

004:020 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did
        Joshua pitch in Gilgal.

004:021 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your
        children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What
        mean these stones?

004:022 Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over
        this Jordan on dry land.

004:023 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from
